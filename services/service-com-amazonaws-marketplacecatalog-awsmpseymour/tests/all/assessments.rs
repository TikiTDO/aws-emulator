//! The AWS Marketplace Catalog assessment reports, and the not-found class of every
//! operation that reads a record, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! Every assertion here goes through the router, so each case exercises routing,
//! deserialization, the handler, the persisted state and serialization — the same path
//! a client takes.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! * `DescribeAssessment` classifies its `AssessmentIdentifier` BEFORE it reads the
//!   store: an identifier of neither modelled form names no assessment, so it is the
//!   modelled `ValidationException`, while one that is well formed but names nothing
//!   stored is the modelled `ResourceNotFoundException`.
//! * `ListAssessments` reports the store as a list — present and empty when nothing
//!   matches, never an absent member — selecting with every filter the model declares
//!   and reporting newest first, and `DescribeAssessment` reports the record the store
//!   holds through either form of identifier.
//! * An id that names no record is a CLIENT refusal naming the resource asked for,
//!   and it leaves the store exactly as it was.
