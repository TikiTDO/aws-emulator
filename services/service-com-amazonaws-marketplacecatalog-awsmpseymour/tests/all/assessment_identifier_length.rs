//! `DescribeAssessmentRequest$AssessmentIdentifier` against BOTH ends of its modelled
//! `@length`, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! One rule is under test: a member this service judges with a predicate of its own
//! stands in for the WHOLE modelled constraint — the `@length(min: 1, max: 2048)` of
//! `AssessmentIdentifier` as well as the syntax the service publishes for it — so an
//! identifier outside either is malformed and refused `422 ValidationException` BEFORE
//! the store is read, whatever the store holds, and only an identifier inside both
//! reaches the lookup, where an unknown one is `404 ResourceNotFoundException` and a held
//! one is served.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: which of the two accepted forms the
//! identifier takes (a bare id, the full assessment ARN), and how long it is — nothing at
//! all, the shortest value either form can take, the published maximum, one character
//! past it and far past it — plus a value inside the bound but outside the syntax, so
//! neither half of the predicate can be dropped without a row failing.
//!
//! `modelled_member_lengths.rs` pins the same rule across the OTHER members this service
//! judges itself; this suite is the one that also pins the lower bound and the ordering
//! against a store that already holds an assessment.
//!
//! An identifier this member admits can be as long as a `Message` may be, so the sentence
//! an answer carries is that sentence with the quoted identifier cut to fit — never a
//! `Message` past `ExceptionMessageContent`'s own `@length`.
