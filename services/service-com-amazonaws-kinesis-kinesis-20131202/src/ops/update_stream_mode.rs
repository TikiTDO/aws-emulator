//! @op UpdateStreamMode
//! Changes the capacity mode of the stream the request names, reading and writing the
//! `streams` store this service's [`crate::state`] owns.
//!
//! RULE: an accepted call stores the requested `StreamModeDetails` on the stream and leaves
//! it `UPDATING` until the transition back to `ACTIVE` falls due, so the mode every later
//! read reports is the one the call named. The call is served only while the stream is
//! `ACTIVE`, so a second change that overlaps one still in flight is refused with the
//! modelled `ResourceInUseException` and leaves the stored mode exactly as it was: of two
//! overlapping calls on one stream, exactly one is accepted.
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request. `ctx`
//! ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only.
//!
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `UpdateStreamMode`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-kinesis-kinesis-20131202/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-kinesis-kinesis-20131202.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Updates the capacity mode of the data stream. Currently, in Kinesis Data Streams, you
//! can choose between an on-demand capacity mode and a provisioned capacity mode for your
//! data stream. If you'd still like to proactively scale your on-demand data stream’s
//! capacity, you can unlock the warm throughput feature for on-demand data streams by
//! enabling MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment for your account. Once your account has
//! MinimumThroughputBillingCommitment enabled, you can specify the warm throughput in MiB
//! per second that your stream can support in writes.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `StreamARN` (StreamARN, len 1..2048, pattern ^arn:aws.*:kinesis:.*:\d{12}:stream/\S+$)
//!   **required** — Specifies the ARN of the data stream whose capacity mode you want to
//!   update.
//! * `StreamId` (StreamId, len 1..24, pattern ^[a-z0-9]{20}-[a-z0-9]{3}$) — Not Implemented.
//!   Reserved for future use.
//! * `StreamModeDetails` (StreamModeDetails) **required** — Specifies the capacity mode to
//!   which you want to set your data stream. Currently, in Kinesis Data Streams, you can
//!   choose between an on-demand capacity mode and a provisioned capacity mode for your data
//!   streams.
//! * `WarmThroughputMiBps` (NaturalIntegerObject, range 0..) — The target warm throughput in
//!   MB/s that the stream should be scaled to handle. This represents the throughput capacity
//!   that will be immediately available for write operations. This field is only valid when
//!   the stream mode is being updated to on-demand.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `InvalidArgumentException` (HTTP 400) — A specified parameter exceeds its restrictions,
//!   is not supported, or can't be used. For more information, see the returned message.
//! * `LimitExceededException` (HTTP 400) — The requested resource exceeds the maximum number
//!   allowed, or the number of concurrent stream requests exceeds the maximum number allowed.
//! * `ResourceInUseException` (HTTP 400) — The resource is not available for this operation.
//!   For successful operation, the resource must be in the ACTIVE state.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 400) — The requested resource could not be found. The
//!   stream might not be specified correctly.
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — Specifies that you tried to invoke this API for a
//!   data stream with the on-demand capacity mode. This API is only supported for data
//!   streams with the provisioned capacity mode.
