//! The AWS Support case a tax-exemption submission opens, written to the control
//! plane that owns support cases.
//!
//! `PutTaxExemption` submits an exemption certificate for review and answers "the
//! customer support case ID" of the case that review happens on
//! (`smithy_query(query="doc", shape="PutTaxExemptionResponse", member="caseId")`),
//! which is why the operation models a failure to "upload the tax exemption
//! document to Amazon Web Services Support case" and the Support "case creation
//! limit for your account". A `caseId` is therefore a handle into AWS Support: the
//! caller hands it to `support:DescribeCases` and `support:DescribeCommunications`
//! to follow the review of the document it submitted.
//!
//! So the case is created where cases live — the AWS Support store on the one
//! shared engine, through that service's own single case writer — rather than
//! being an id this service makes up. The id this service answers is the one that
//! store minted, and the certificate is attached to the case's first
//! communication, so the submitted document is retained by the service that
//! reviews it.
//!
//! A one-directional, guard-free write, exactly like [`super::organization`]'s
//! read: it takes the Support store's lock, holds no other while it does, hands
//! back owned values — so call it with NO guard of this service's own store held.
