//! The transaction ONE SESSION has open, and what its snapshot and its commit mean.
//!
//! A transaction belongs to the session that opened it: `BEGIN` … `COMMIT` brackets the
//! statements of THAT connection, two sessions hold two independent transactions at once,
//! and one session's `ROLLBACK` undoes its own work and nobody else's. The embedded engine
//! (SQLite) runs one transaction per database at a time, which is why the transaction a
//! session opens cannot be the engine's. It is kept here instead, as a SNAPSHOT and a set of
//! changed rows:
//!
//! * the database as it stood at the transaction's first statement in it — a page-for-page
//!   copy made by the engine's own online backup, which is the database the transaction's
//!   own statements then run against (`super::sql_engine`), so what it writes is in its copy
//!   and nowhere else until it commits, and what another session commits meanwhile does not
//!   move under it;
//! * WHICH rows it has changed since, from the engine's update hook, which reports every row
//!   an `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` touched, including the rows a cascading foreign-key
//!   action or a trigger touched with it.
//!
//! A `COMMIT` then makes exactly those rows of the shared database what the transaction's own
//! copy holds for them ([`apply_rows`]), so a session opened after it reads them, and a
//! `ROLLBACK` drops the copy, which leaves the shared database exactly as it was. Nothing
//! here reads a statement's text to work out what it did.
//!
//! The limits of keeping a transaction this way, both of them stated rather than hidden:
//!
//! * the snapshot is taken ONCE per database per transaction, so a transaction reads the
//!   same rows throughout — the REPEATABLE READ that is MySQL's default level, and stronger
//!   than the READ COMMITTED a PostgreSQL session asks for by default, which would show it
//!   each statement's own snapshot;
//! * what a commit carries over is the ROWS it changed and the SCHEMA CHANGES it made
//!   ([`apply_schema`]) — its own delta against the schema its copy declared when the copy
//!   was taken, so an object the transaction never touched is left exactly as the shared
//!   database holds it; a row another transaction inserted at the same engine row id in the
//!   same table between the snapshot and the commit is one this cannot distinguish from its
//!   own.
