//! End-to-end tests for what one SESSION's transaction shows every other session on the
//! same DB instance endpoint.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! * a row a transaction has written and not committed is invisible to every other session
//!   until it commits: another session reads the rows as they stood before;
//! * a transaction reads the same rows throughout: a value another session commits while it
//!   is open does not move under it;
//! * once a transaction commits, every session that reads afterwards reads what it wrote,
//!   and a `ROLLBACK` leaves the shared database exactly as the transaction found it;
//! * two transactions that write DIFFERENT rows both commit, and each row ends up holding
//!   the value the transaction that wrote it chose.
//!
//! The table spans what the rules generalise over: an insert, an update and a delete; a
//! transaction that commits and one that rolls back; a reader that is itself inside a
//! transaction and one that is not; and the concurrent pair whose writes do not overlap.
//!
//! Every client here is the wire client the endpoint suite drives
//! ([`crate::db_instance_engine_endpoint`]), so each "session" is a real connection with its
//! own transaction, in one process.
