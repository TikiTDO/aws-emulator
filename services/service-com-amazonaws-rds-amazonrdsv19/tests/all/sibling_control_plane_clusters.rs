//! End-to-end tests for the DB clusters this front door creates for ANOTHER control
//! plane's engine, and for the two refusals the cluster lifecycle turns on.
//!
//! One awsQuery front door serves three control planes: this model's wire identity
//! (`endpointPrefix` / `sigv4Name` `rds`, `awsQuery`, version `2014-10-31`) is published
//! identically by the Amazon DocumentDB and Amazon Neptune models, so a client compiled
//! against either of those APIs signs for `rds` and is answered HERE (`src/service.rs`).
//! A cluster of such an engine is still a resource of THAT service, so what it reports is
//! that service's published values and not this model's.
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a SET of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! * a cluster created without a `Port` listens on the port its ENGINE's own control plane
//!   publishes as the default, and the endpoints of the cluster and of its member instances
//!   sit in that control plane's DNS domain — spanned over the two sibling engines, two
//!   Aurora engines and a Multi-AZ DB cluster engine, with a request that names its own
//!   port as the control;
//! * a cluster whose storage size is not fixed reports `AllocatedStorage` as the one
//!   gibibyte the member is expressed in, while a Multi-AZ DB cluster reports the size its
//!   request allocated — same table;
//! * a cluster takes the `StorageType` value list its engine's own control plane publishes,
//!   reports a non-default type and does not report the default one — spanned over both
//!   sibling engines, every value each of them publishes, the request that names none, and
//!   a value belonging to another cluster type;
//! * a delete that names neither of its two final-snapshot members is refused
//!   `InvalidParameterCombination`, asking for one of them — spanned over the engines and
//!   over the snapshot-member combinations;
//! * a `MasterUserPassword` outside its documented length or character set is refused
//!   `InvalidParameterValue`, naming the member and the constraint it broke — spanned over
//!   both bounds, the values just inside them and the forbidden characters, on the create
//!   and on the modify.
