//! End-to-end tests for the reference catalogs this one front door publishes on behalf of
//! the graph engine's control plane, and for how the two reports that RESOLVE a published
//! name word their refusals.
//!
//! This front door serves three control planes (`src/service.rs`): Amazon RDS, Amazon
//! DocumentDB and Amazon Neptune publish one wire identity, so a Neptune client signs `rds`
//! and its catalog reads land here. The rules these tables pin:
//!
//! 1. a `DBParameterGroupFamily` is published reference data — the families the
//!    engine-version catalogue reports plus the ones this model's own member value list
//!    publishes — so a value outside that list is refused with the service's one sentence,
//!    whatever shape the value has;
//! 2. each parameter LEVEL of a family publishes its own catalog, with that engine's own
//!    catalog text, in its own order;
//! 3. a parameter a GROUP carries is described by the record its family publishes for it,
//!    at whichever level that family publishes it — a parameter group's family is not
//!    scoped to the engine of the control plane the group was created through;
//! 4. the engine-version report publishes the graph engine's default release, its
//!    exportable log types and its serverless capacity range;
//! 5. the two reports that resolve an `Engine` word an unrecognised value the way the real
//!    service words it for THAT operation.
//!
//! Every assertion spans a table rather than one request: families of several engines and
//! several shapes of non-family, both parameter levels, groups of four families, every
//! published major-version family of the graph engine, and five values that name no engine.
//!
//! The harness (`emulator`, `call`, `expect_ok`, `expect_error` and the element readers) is
//! the [`crate::db_instances`] suite's, and the group create/modify pair is
//! [`crate::cluster_parameter_groups`]'s, reused rather than copied.
