//! End-to-end tests for the DB CLUSTER engine endpoint: the `Endpoint`/`Port` a DB cluster
//! publishes, and the PostgreSQL and MySQL sessions a client opens on it.
//!
//! The rule under test: for every DB cluster whose engine speaks a wire this emulator
//! serves, the address the cluster publishes as its `Endpoint`/`Port` is a listener that
//! SERVES that engine — a client completes the engine's own handshake on it within seconds
//! of the cluster reporting `available`, authenticating as the cluster's `MasterUsername`
//! with the password RDS holds in the managed `MasterUserSecret`, into the cluster's
//! `DatabaseName`, and the session reports that same database and login. A cluster whose
//! engine speaks neither wire publishes no listener and keeps the DNS-form endpoint it
//! always had, and a cluster that is deleted takes its listener with it.
//!
//! The client is the one the sibling DB INSTANCE endpoint suite drives
//! ([`crate::db_instance_engine_endpoint`]): both wires written against the protocol
//! itself, so what is exercised here is what a stock driver speaks. Secrets Manager and KMS
//! are mounted beside the RDS service, because the password a session logs in with is the
//! one RDS generated into the managed secret and is read back through Secrets Manager's own
//! `GetSecretValue` — the sequence a client that asks RDS to manage its master password
//! follows.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: both wires (Aurora PostgreSQL, Aurora
//! MySQL), both cluster types (an Aurora cluster and a Multi-AZ DB cluster), a cluster that
//! names its own `DatabaseName` beside one that leaves it to the engine's own default, and
//! an engine whose wire this emulator does not serve.
