//! `GRANT` and `REVOKE` on a DB instance's PostgreSQL endpoint, and the IAM database
//! authentication a role grant turns on.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a table of statements rather than one recorded
//! one:
//!
//! * a PostgreSQL endpoint SERVES the `GRANT`/`REVOKE` forms its grammar defines — role
//!   membership (`GRANT <role> TO <role>`) and object privileges (`GRANT <privileges> ON
//!   <object> TO <grantee>`) — recording each in the catalog PostgreSQL keeps it in
//!   (`pg_auth_members`, and the object's own `relacl` / `nspacl` / `datacl`), so a client
//!   reads back exactly what it granted; `syntax error at or near "<token>"` is what a
//!   statement the grammar does NOT define is refused with, and a statement that names a
//!   role or an object the instance does not have takes that condition's own sentence
//!   instead;
//! * a DB instance with `EnableIAMDatabaseAuthentication` admits a login as a database user
//!   ENABLED for it — on PostgreSQL, a member of `rds_iam` — presenting an authentication
//!   token generated for that endpoint, that port and that user, and admits nothing else:
//!   not a user nothing enabled, not a token for another user, and not a token outside its
//!   window.
//!
//! The rows differ along what each rule generalises over: the statement's form, the
//! privileges and the kind of object they are granted on, the grantee (a role and `PUBLIC`),
//! and, for the token, every claim it carries.
