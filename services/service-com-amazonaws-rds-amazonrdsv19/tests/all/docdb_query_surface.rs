//! End-to-end tests for the awsQuery surface this front door shares with the Amazon
//! DocumentDB and Amazon Neptune control planes: the error ENVELOPE every refusal is
//! wrapped in, the ORDER in which a request's addressed resource and its referenced
//! resources are resolved, and the two reports of published reference data that span
//! every engine this door serves.
//!
//! One Query front door serves three control planes — this model's wire identity
//! (`endpointPrefix` / `sigv4Name` `rds`, `awsQuery`, version `2014-10-31`) is published
//! identically by the DocumentDB and Neptune models, so a request signed for `rds` reaches
//! THIS service whichever of the three APIs the caller compiled against
//! (`src/service.rs`). Every rule below therefore has to hold for a caller of any of them,
//! which is what these tables span.
//!
//! The rules pinned here, each over a SET of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! * every awsQuery error response carries a `<RequestId>` in its `<ErrorResponse>`
//!   envelope — spanned over the layers that can produce one (a modelled fault from a
//!   handler, a handler's own refusal, a framework refusal for an absent required member,
//!   an unroutable `Action`, an API version this door does not serve), and the ids are
//!   distinct per response while a SUCCESS keeps its `ResponseMetadata/RequestId`;
//! * the resource a request ADDRESSES is resolved before any rule about how its other
//!   members combine — spanned over every combination of `DeleteDBInstance`'s two snapshot
//!   members, against an instance that does not exist and against one that does;
//! * a create resolves every resource it REFERENCES before admitting a record — spanned
//!   over `CreateDBInstance`'s `DBClusterIdentifier` on several engines and identifier
//!   forms, with the no-reference row as the control;
//! * `DefaultOnly` either names the one default version of the engine asked for or is
//!   refused with `InvalidParameterCombination` — spanned over EVERY engine this door's
//!   catalogue reports, read from the catalogue itself;
//! * an engine version reports the CA certificates it can be launched with, and they are
//!   the ones `DescribeCertificates` reports that have not expired — spanned over every
//!   engine, with the certificate catalogue as the source of truth;
//! * an orderable option of an engine this door serves for another control plane is a
//!   cluster member — spanned over every engine and every class the report offers.
