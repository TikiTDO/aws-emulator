//! What an effective-preferences read reports for a preference whose own vocabulary names
//! the not-set state.
//!
//! The rule: a preference whose value set itself names the state of a resource no record
//! covers is REPORTED as a status, always — the value of the most specific scope that sets
//! it, and the service's documented default where none does — so the member is never
//! dropped from an answer. `enhancedInfrastructureMetrics` is such a preference: "a status
//! of `Active` confirms that the preference is applied in the latest recommendation
//! refresh, and a status of `Inactive` confirms that it's not yet applied to
//! recommendations" (`EffectiveRecommendationPreferences$enhancedInfrastructureMetrics`),
//! so `Inactive` IS the answer for a resource with nothing on record. A preference whose
//! own documentation makes absence the answer — `externalMetricsPreference`, "if the
//! preference isn't applied to the recommendations already, then this object doesn't appear
//! in the response" — stays absent, which the table below pins too.
//!
//! The table spans what the resolution generalises over: which scope holds the record
//! (none, organization, account, the resource itself, another resource), which value it
//! holds (every value of the model's own `EnhancedInfrastructureMetrics` set), whether the
//! record sets this preference at all, and which of the two resource ARN forms the read
//! names. The reported status is never an echo of a stored record: the rows prove a written
//! value wins over the default, a more specific scope wins over a less specific one, and a
//! deleted record falls back to the default again.
