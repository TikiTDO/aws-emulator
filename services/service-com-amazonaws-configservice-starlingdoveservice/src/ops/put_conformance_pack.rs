//! @op PutConformancePack
//!
//! Creates or updates a conformance pack — "a collection of Config rules that can be
//! easily deployed in an account and a region" — and the CloudFormation stack it is
//! deployed as.
//!
//! What this handler enforces, and where each rule comes from:
//!
//! * "You must specify only one of the follow parameters: TemplateS3Uri, TemplateBody
//!   or TemplateSSMDocumentDetails": a request carrying none of them, or more than one,
//!   is refused with the modelled `InvalidParameterValueException`;
//! * a `TemplateBody` is READ as the YAML (or JSON, which YAML 1.2 is a superset of)
//!   template it must be, and must declare the resource types a conformance pack
//!   template declares ([`CONFORMANCE_PACK_TEMPLATE_RESOURCE_TYPES`]); a body that is
//!   neither is refused with the modelled `ConformancePackTemplateValidationException`
//!   ("You have specified a template that is not valid or supported") and leaves NO
//!   pack behind for that name;
//! * "PutConformancePack is an idempotent API. Subsequent requests won't create a
//!   duplicate resource if one was already created": a second call for the same name
//!   redeploys that pack rather than creating another, and "tags will not be updated,
//!   even if they are different";
//! * "For PutConformancePack ..., a conformance pack creation, update, and deletion is
//!   in progress. Try your request again later." (`ResourceInUseException`): the
//!   deployment this call starts is still in flight when it answers, so a further call
//!   for a pack whose deployment has not settled is refused rather than restarting work
//!   in progress — the idempotency above is what a call for a SETTLED pack gets, and the
//!   refusal NAMES the pack whose workflow holds it
//!   ([`crate::state::conformance_pack_workflow_in_progress_message`]), rather than
//!   repeating the error shape's documentation sentence;
//! * a NEW pack has to fit under this Region's conformance pack quota
//!   ([`crate::state::CONFORMANCE_PACKS_QUOTA`]), else
//!   `MaxNumberOfConformancePacksExceededException`;
//! * the deployment is not finished when this call answers: the pack is
//!   `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` until the clock makes `CREATE_COMPLETE` due
//!   ([`crate::state::CONFORMANCE_PACK_DEPLOY_SETTLE_AFTER`]), which is what
//!   `DescribeConformancePackStatus` reports.
//!
//! A template Config has to FETCH to read — `TemplateS3Uri`, whose body is an Amazon S3
//! object, and `TemplateSSMDocumentDetails`, whose body is a Systems Manager document —
//! is not read here: this handler cannot see either store, so rather than deploy a pack
//! from a template it never read it answers the scaffold's 501 for those two legs alone.
//!
//! ## What a deployment here does
//!
//! The deployment CREATES what the template declares: each `AWS::Config::ConfigRule` is
//! written into this account's Config rules, under the name Config gives a pack's rule
//! ([`crate::state::conformance_pack_rule_name`]) and carrying the pack's service
//! principal as its `CreatedBy`, and each `AWS::Config::RemediationConfiguration` is
//! written as the remediation of the rule it names. So a pack this operation reports
//! `CREATE_COMPLETE` is one whose rules `DescribeConfigRules` reports and whose
//! remediation actions `DescribeRemediationConfigurations` reports; a REDEPLOY of the
//! same pack replaces exactly the resources its previous deployment created; and a
//! deployment whose rules would not fit under this Region's Config rules quota creates
//! nothing — leaving a previous deployment of the same pack standing — and is reported in
//! the modelled `CREATE_FAILED` state with the reason
//! (`ConformancePackStatusReason`) rather than as a completion of work nothing performed.
//!
//! What the deployment does NOT do is evaluate those rules itself: the evaluation is the
//! pass Config owes a rule it has just created ("when you create a rule, Config evaluates
//! your resources against the rule automatically", `PutConfigRule`), which the in-process
//! pump runs ([`crate::state::drive_recorder_clock`]) — so a rule whose implementation
//! this emulator has is placed at a verdict a span after this call answers, and the pack's
//! own compliance surface (`DescribeConformancePackCompliance`,
//! `GetConformancePackComplianceDetails`, `GetConformancePackComplianceSummary`) reports
//! those results. A rule whose implementation this emulator does not have records no
//! verdict at all rather than a synthesised one, and reports the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` of a
//! rule nothing has evaluated.
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `PutConformancePack::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `PutConformancePack`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-configservice-starlingdoveservice/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-configservice-starlingdoveservice.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Creates or updates a conformance pack. A conformance pack is a collection of Config
//! rules that can be easily deployed in an account and a region and across an organization.
//! For information on how many conformance packs you can have per account, see Service
//! Limits in the Config Developer Guide. When you use PutConformancePack to deploy
//! conformance packs in your account, the operation can create Config rules and remediation
//! actions without requiring config:PutConfigRule or config:PutRemediationConfigurations
//! permissions in your account IAM policies. This API uses the
//! AWSServiceRoleForConfigConforms service-linked role in your account to create
//! conformance pack resources. This service-linked role includes the permissions to create
//! Config rules and remediation configurations, even if your account IAM policies
//! explicitly deny these actions. This API creates a service-linked role
//! AWSServiceRoleForConfigConforms in your account. The service-linked role is created only
//! when the role does not exist in your account. You must specify only one of the follow
//! parameters: TemplateS3Uri, TemplateBody or TemplateSSMDocumentDetails. Tags are added at
//! creation and cannot be updated with this operation PutConformancePack is an idempotent
//! API. Subsequent requests won't create a duplicate resource if one was already created.
//! If a following request has different tags values, Config will ignore these differences
//! and treat it as an idempotent request of the previous. In this case, tags will not be
//! updated, even if they are different. Use TagResource and UntagResource to update tags
//! after creation.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `ConformancePackInputParameters` (ConformancePackInputParameters, len 0..60) — A list of
//!   ConformancePackInputParameter objects.
//! * `ConformancePackName` (ConformancePackName, len 1..256, pattern ^[a-zA-Z][-a-zA-Z0-9]*$)
//!   **required** — The unique name of the conformance pack you want to deploy.
//! * `DeliveryS3Bucket` (DeliveryS3Bucket, len 0..63) — The name of the Amazon S3 bucket
//!   where Config stores conformance pack templates. This field is optional.
//! * `DeliveryS3KeyPrefix` (DeliveryS3KeyPrefix, len 0..1024) — The prefix for the Amazon S3
//!   bucket. This field is optional.
//! * `Tags` (TagsList, len 0..50) — The tags for the conformance pack. Each tag consists of a
//!   key and an optional value, both of which you define.
//! * `TemplateBody` (TemplateBody, len 1..51200) — A string that contains the full
//!   conformance pack template body. The structure containing the template body has a minimum
//!   length of 1 byte and a maximum length of 51,200 bytes. You can use a YAML template with
//!   two resource types: Config rule (AWS::Config::ConfigRule) and remediation action
//!   (AWS::Config::RemediationConfiguration).
//! * `TemplateS3Uri` (TemplateS3Uri, len 1..1024, pattern ^s3://) — The location of the file
//!   containing the template body (s3://bucketname/prefix). The uri must point to a
//!   conformance pack template (max size: 300 KB) that is located in an Amazon S3 bucket in
//!   the same Region as the conformance pack. You must have access to read Amazon S3 bucket.
//!   In addition, in order to ensure a successful deployment, the template object must not be
//!   in an archived storage class if this parameter is passed.
//! * `TemplateSSMDocumentDetails` (TemplateSSMDocumentDetails) — An object of type
//!   TemplateSSMDocumentDetails, which contains the name or the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of
//!   the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager document (SSM document) and the version of the
//!   SSM document that is used to create a conformance pack.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `ConformancePackArn` (ConformancePackArn, len 1..2048) — ARN of the conformance pack.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ConformancePackTemplateValidationException` (HTTP 400) — You have specified a template
//!   that is not valid or supported.
//! * `InsufficientPermissionsException` (HTTP 400) — Indicates one of the following errors:
//!   For PutConfigRule, the rule cannot be created because the IAM role assigned to Config
//!   lacks permissions to perform the config:Put* action. For PutConfigRule, the Lambda
//!   function cannot be invoked. Check the function ARN, and check the function's
//!   permissions. For PutOrganizationConfigRule, organization Config rule cannot be created
//!   because you do not have permissions to call IAM GetRole action or create a
//!   service-linked role. For PutConformancePack and PutOrganizationConformancePack, a
//!   conformance pack cannot be created because you do not have the following permissions:
//!   You do not have permission to call IAM GetRole action or create a service-linked …
//! * `InvalidParameterValueException` (HTTP 400) — One or more of the specified parameters
//!   are not valid. Verify that your parameters are valid and try again.
//! * `MaxNumberOfConformancePacksExceededException` (HTTP 400) — You have reached the limit
//!   of the number of conformance packs you can create in an account. For more information,
//!   see Service Limits in the Config Developer Guide.
//! * `ResourceInUseException` (HTTP 400) — You see this exception in the following cases: For
//!   DeleteConfigRule, Config is deleting this rule. Try your request again later. For
//!   DeleteConfigRule, the rule is deleting your evaluation results. Try your request again
//!   later. For DeleteConfigRule, a remediation action is associated with the rule and Config
//!   cannot delete this rule. Delete the remediation action associated with the rule before
//!   deleting the rule and try your request again later. For PutConfigOrganizationRule,
//!   organization Config rule deletion is in progress. Try your request again later. For
//!   DeleteOrganizationConfigRule, organization Config rule creation is in progress. Try your
//!   request again later. For PutConformancePack and …
