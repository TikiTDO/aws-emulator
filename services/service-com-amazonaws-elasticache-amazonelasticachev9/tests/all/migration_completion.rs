//! End-to-end tests for `CompleteMigration`.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! * "Completes the migration of data" — the cutover it performs closes the ONE open
//!   migration recorded on the target the request names, so the target a later read
//!   reports carries no migration and a second completion is refused;
//! * a cutover exists only inside a migration that is MIGRATING: a target carrying none,
//!   or one whose data sync is not in flight because the work that establishes it is still
//!   under way, is refused with the modelled parameter refusal that states that rule — and
//!   `Force`, which bypasses the data-in-sync check, is not a way around it;
//! * a migration has ONE target, so a request naming both or neither is refused, and a
//!   target this account does not hold is that target's own not-found fault.
//!
//! The tests are tables: the rows span which target the request names, whether `Force` is
//! sent, which phase an open migration is in, and each way a request can be wrong, so no
//! single recorded request is what makes them pass.
//!
//! Every assertion goes over the wire through the same router the production emulator
//! mounts. The one exception is the serverless rows: the migration a completion closes is
//! opened by `PrepareMigration`, which is still a scaffolded 501 with its own gap issue,
//! so those rows seed the migration through [`crate::harness::Emulator::with_state`] — the
//! same store the handlers read — and then assert over the wire that the answer is
//! computed FROM it.
