//! The ONE answer to "which VPC security groups does this account have", for every
//! ElastiCache operation that attaches a resource to them.
//!
//! A VPC security group is an Amazon EC2 resource, so every operation of this service that
//! takes a `SecurityGroupIds` — `CreateCacheCluster`, `CreateReplicationGroup`,
//! `CreateServerlessCache` and the three modify operations that change which groups guard an
//! existing resource — resolves each identifier it is given against what EC2 holds for the
//! account in the Region the request is signed for. An identifier EC2 reports a group for is
//! accepted and attached to the stored resource; one it reports none for — never minted,
//! minted and then deleted, or a filter pattern rather than an identifier — is refused
//! `InvalidParameterValue`, the refusal names the identifiers that did not resolve and the
//! account the request was made for, and nothing is written: a refused create leaves no
//! resource and a refused modify leaves the groups the resource already had.
//!
//! The second half of the same resolution is WHICH VPC each group EC2 answered for guards: a
//! security group only ever guards network interfaces of its own VPC, so a request naming a
//! group of another VPC than the cache subnet group the resource is placed in is refused
//! `InvalidParameterCombination` naming the subnet group and both VPCs, and again nothing is
//! written.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: how many identifiers the request
//! names, whether one is held or absent and in which position, the form the absent one takes
//! (both the short and the long id form AWS has used, and a filter pattern), whether an
//! absent identifier was never minted or was minted and deleted, and which VPC a group that
//! IS the account's belongs to. The operations are the other axis, so no single recorded
//! request is what makes this suite pass.
//!
//! EC2 is mounted beside ElastiCache on ONE engine by [`crate::harness`] and driven through
//! the AWS SDK over the same in-process callback this service's own resolution reaches it
//! through. Every identifier a row holds was MINTED by EC2 or is deliberately absent, so no
//! id written here can pass itself off as one the account holds.
