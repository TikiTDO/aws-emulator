//! End-to-end tests for `DescribeCacheEngineVersions`.
//!
//! Every assertion goes over the wire, through the same router the production
//! emulator mounts, and nothing reaches into the service's state struct — so a
//! response that is not computed from the published catalog cannot pass. The
//! request builder and the XML reader are the ones the `cache_cluster_lifecycle`
//! suite marks `pub(crate)`, so this target keeps one harness rather than a
//! second copy that could drift.
//!
//! The tests are tables: each row is one input along the axis the rule under
//! test generalises over (which filter carries a value, how that value selects —
//! an exact version, a version line, a family, a case variant, a value nothing
//! matches — the page size, and the refused value), so no single recorded
//! request is what makes them pass.
