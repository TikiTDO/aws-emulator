//! The engine versions a create or an upgrade may NAME: the ones the service offers.
//!
//! `DescribeCacheEngineVersions` publishes the catalogue of engines and versions this
//! account can run — AWS publishes it, no operation adds to it — and that catalogue is what
//! a client picks an `EngineVersion` from. So every operation of this service that takes an
//! `EngineVersion` (`CreateCacheCluster`, `CreateReplicationGroup`, `ModifyCacheCluster`,
//! `ModifyReplicationGroup`) accepts a version the catalogue offers for that engine — the
//! version itself, or the version LINE one belongs to, which is the same reading the
//! describe's own `EngineVersion` filter has — and refuses anything else with the modelled
//! `InvalidParameterCombinationException` (`awsQueryError` code
//! `InvalidParameterCombination`, HTTP 400) and the sentence
//! `Cannot find version <version> for <engine>`, writing nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the engine, whether the value is a
//! published version, a version line, a version of ANOTHER engine, a prefix of a published
//! version that is not a line of it, or a version past everything published; and whether the
//! operation creates the resource or changes one that exists. Every "offered" row is checked
//! against what the describe ANSWERS first, so the table cannot drift from the published
//! catalogue, and every "absent" row is checked to be absent from it.
