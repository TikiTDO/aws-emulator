//! End-to-end tests for `TestMigration`, and for the sentence the operation that STARTS a
//! migration refuses a group whose status cannot take one with.
//!
//! The rules under test:
//!
//! * "Async API to test connection between source and target replication group" — the call
//!   decides whether there is a migration to test at all: the group has to be one this
//!   account holds, provisioned and idle, carrying no migration of its own, and the list has
//!   to name endpoints a migration could read from ("List should have only one element"). A
//!   call that passes those reports the group it tested and changes NOTHING about it, so a
//!   `StartMigration` right after one is accepted;
//! * a refusal is the modelled fault of the thing that is wrong — the group's own not-found
//!   fault (404), its state fault, its already-under-migration fault, and the parameter
//!   refusal for a value no group could carry or a list no test could read — and each states
//!   its rule in ElastiCache's own words.
//!
//! The tests are tables: the rows span how the group is partitioned, which way a request can
//! be wrong, and which status the group is in, so no single recorded request is what makes
//! them pass.
//!
//! Every assertion goes over the wire through the same router the production emulator
//! mounts, with the shared `harness` request builder and XML reader.
