//! How this service words a request that OMITS a parameter the model requires.
//!
//! The framework finds the absence before any handler runs and describes it structurally
//! rather than as a sentence (a [`Refusal::Invalid`] carrying a
//! [`ViolationKind::MissingRequiredMember`]), because services do not agree on either the
//! code or the prose. ElastiCache states it as a bad parameter value: HTTP 400,
//! `InvalidParameterValue`, and the sentence `The parameter <Name> must be provided.`,
//! naming the parameter by the public name the request would have carried it under.
//!
//! That is one choice for the whole service rather than one per operation, so a client
//! reads the same code and the same shape of sentence whichever required parameter it left
//! out — and the same code it gets for a value the service cannot take.
