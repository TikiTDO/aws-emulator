//! Changing how many node groups (shards) a replication group has.
//!
//! `ModifyReplicationGroupShardConfiguration` "modifies a replication group's shards
//! (node groups) by allowing you to add shards, remove shards, or rebalance the keyspaces
//! among existing shards", and all three are ONE write over the group's stored shards
//! ([`ReplicationGroupRecord::node_groups`]): the shards the request retains stay, the
//! ones it removes go with their member CLUSTERS, the ones it adds are minted with member
//! clusters of their own, and the keyspace is then partitioned across whatever shards the
//! group ends up with.
//!
//! A shard's member is a cache CLUSTER (which is why
//! [`ComAmazonawsElasticacheAmazonelasticachev9State::insert_replication_group`] puts
//! every member in [`ComAmazonawsElasticacheAmazonelasticachev9State::cache_clusters`]),
//! so a reshard creates and removes those clusters too — otherwise
//! `DescribeCacheClusters` and `DescribeReplicationGroups` would disagree about what the
//! account runs. That is the same reason
//! [`ComAmazonawsElasticacheAmazonelasticachev9State::set_shard_replica_count`] mints and
//! drops clusters when a shard's replica count changes; this slice is its shard-count
//! counterpart.
