//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-budgets-awsbudgetservicegateway service.
//!
//! The resource this service is built around is the **Budget**. AWS gives a budget
//! its identity from the account that owns it plus its name — `Budget$BudgetName`
//! is documented as "The name must be unique within an account" — so the store is
//! keyed by that pair. A budget OWNS the notifications, their subscribers and the
//! resource tags created with it ("After the end date, Amazon Web Services deletes
//! the budget and all the associated notifications and subscribers"), so they are
//! held inside the stored budget and go away with it. The budget ACTIONS created on
//! it are held the same way: an action carries the name of its budget
//! (`Action$BudgetName`) and every action operation names that budget beside the
//! `ActionId`, so an action cannot outlive the budget it acts on.
//!
//! That same sentence also bounds a budget's LIFE: a budget's `TimePeriod$End` is the
//! instant after which AWS holds it no longer, so the store is reached through
//! [`store_at`], which materialises every deletion the clock has already made due
//! ([`expire_due_budgets`]) before any operation sees it.
//!
//! The helpers below (ARN rendering, the opaque pagination token, the cross-member
//! rules `CreateBudget`/`UpdateBudget` document) are shared by several operation
//! handlers, so they live here rather than being copied into each `src/ops` file —
//! a new file under `src/ops/` would be picked up by `build.rs` as an operation.
