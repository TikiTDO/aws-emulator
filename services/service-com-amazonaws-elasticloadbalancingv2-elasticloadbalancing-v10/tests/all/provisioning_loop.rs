//! The ELBv2 provisioning loop, end to end over the wire: create a load balancer,
//! give it a target group and a listener, register targets, read everything back and
//! tear it down.
//!
//! Every request goes through the router exactly as a client's would — awsQuery form
//! body in, `<{Operation}Response>` XML out — so these tests exercise the wire
//! protocol as well as the handlers, and every assertion is made on what a later
//! read reports rather than on what the create answered.
//!
//! This module also carries the harness every suite in this crate shares: the router
//! over one engine ([`emulator`]), the awsQuery request helpers, the XML readers, and
//! the seeding of a record a suite needs at an exact instant ([`seed_trust_store`]).
