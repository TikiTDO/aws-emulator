//! The health of a registration another emulated service's SCHEDULER owns follows whether
//! the workload behind it listens on the port the health check CONNECTS to.
//!
//! The rule asserted here: **a health check connects to the target group's effective
//! health-check port — `HealthCheckPort` when it names one, and the port the target
//! receives traffic on when it names `traffic-port` or nothing — so a registration whose
//! workload declares the ports it listens on is reported `healthy` only while that port is
//! one of them, and settles on `unhealthy` with the reason its check failed for, and a
//! description, when it is not. On the way to either verdict the registration is `initial`,
//! so one whose checks are failing is never reported healthy. A registration nothing
//! declares ports for is not failed on the port: nothing was observed about it.**
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: how the health-check port is
//! spelled (left out, `traffic-port`, a number equal to the traffic port, a number beside
//! it), how many ports the workload declares, whether it declares them one by one or as a
//! range, and whether it declares any at all. The configuration a recording happens to show
//! — a container port of 80 health-checked on 8888 — is a single row.
//!
//! The registrations are made through the state seam another service's scheduler registers
//! a workload through (`TargetGroupRecord::register_for`, what Amazon ECS calls for the
//! tasks its `loadBalancers` bind), because no operation of this service registers a
//! workload; everything asserted is read back over the wire through `DescribeTargetHealth`.
//! The end-to-end path from an ECS service to these verdicts is asserted by
//! `core/router/tests/all/ecs_service_target_group_health_check_port.rs`.
