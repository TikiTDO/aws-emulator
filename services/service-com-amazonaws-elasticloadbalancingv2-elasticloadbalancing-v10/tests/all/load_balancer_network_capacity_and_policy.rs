//! The load-balancer-level network, capacity-reservation and resource-policy operations —
//! over the wire, through the router.
//!
//! The rules these tables pin:
//!
//! * An operation that addresses ONE load balancer through its required
//!   `LoadBalancerArn` and finds none refuses with its modelled
//!   `LoadBalancerNotFoundException` (awsQuery code `LoadBalancerNotFound`, HTTP 400 —
//!   `smithy_query(query="operation",operation="…")`) and a message naming the ARN the
//!   request carried, in an `<ErrorResponse>` that carries the `<RequestId>` AWS puts
//!   beside `<Error>`; never a 501, which would say nobody has written the operation, and
//!   never `InvalidAction`, which would say the API has no such action.
//! * `SetIpAddressType`, `SetSecurityGroups`, `SetSubnets` and `ModifyIpPools` each
//!   persist what the request names onto that load balancer and answer what it then
//!   carries, which is what a later `DescribeLoadBalancers` reports; a request outside a
//!   rule their own documentation states is the modelled
//!   `InvalidConfigurationRequestException`.
//! * `ModifyCapacityReservation` refuses a request to configure minimum capacity with the
//!   modelled `OperationNotPermittedException`, because reserving capacity is a capability
//!   this account does not have, and serves a reset; `DescribeCapacityReservation` reports
//!   the reservation the store holds.
//! * `GetResourcePolicy` answers the policy attached to the trust store the ARN names, and
//!   refuses an ARN that names no such policy with the modelled
//!   `ResourceNotFoundException`.
//!
//! The wire harness (`emulator`, `call`, `action`, `p`, `members`, `first_text`) and the
//! trust-store seeding come from `provisioning_loop`; the load balancer creator from
//! `load_balancer_attributes`.
