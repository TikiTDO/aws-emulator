//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-ssmsap-ssmsap service.
//!
//! The registered SAP application is this service's primary resource: every
//! application-scoped operation (`RegisterApplication`, `GetApplication`,
//! `ListApplications`, `StartApplication`, `StopApplication`,
//! `StartApplicationRefresh`, `UpdateApplicationSettings`, `DeregisterApplication`)
//! resolves the SAME
//! [`StoredApplication`] out of
//! [`RegionState::applications`], and every call that changes one files a
//! [`StoredOperation`] in [`RegionState::operations`] that `GetOperation` reads back and
//! `ListOperations` reports per application ([`RegionState::operations_for`]).
//! So a register is observable by every later read, a deregister by every later call,
//! and an `OperationId` handed to a caller always names a record that exists.
//!
//! Those calls are ASYNCHRONOUS, so what they start is a change the CLOCK owes the
//! application ([`PendingTransition`]): the next status it takes, the settings an update
//! asked for ([`PendingSettings`]), or — for a
//! deregistration — the removal that ends it. Until that change falls due the
//! application resolves in the transient status the call gave it (`REGISTERING`,
//! `STARTING`, `STOPPING`, `DELETING`), and [`RegionState::settle`] materialises the
//! change for every reader at the same instant without anything ever sleeping.
//!
//! WHICH change a registration owes is the outcome of the DISCOVERY it runs on the Amazon
//! EC2 instances it named ([`discovery::run_document`]): a discovery that can be carried
//! out brings the application to `ACTIVATED`/`SUCCESS`, and one that cannot brings it to
//! `FAILED`/`REGISTRATION_FAILED` with the refusal it ran into on the operation record
//! the registration filed ([`StoredOperation::terminal_status`]). So a registration is
//! reported as successful only where the instances it named really can be reached, and
//! every call whose precondition is a working application reads that outcome off the
//! application ([`StoredApplication::registered_successfully`],
//! [`StoredApplication::registration_failed`]) rather than off what else is in flight.
//!
//! Those records are held PER REGION: the service is regional, so the store is a
//! [`RegionState`] per Region ([`ComAmazonawsSsmsapSsmsapState::region`]) and a handler
//! only ever reaches the partition of the Region its request was signed for
//! ([`request_region`]).
//!
//! A configuration check is the service's OTHER asynchronous unit of work:
//! `StartConfigurationChecks` files one [`StoredConfigurationCheckOperation`] per
//! requested check in [`RegionState::configuration_check_operations`], which
//! `GetConfigurationCheckOperation` reads back by its id and
//! `ListConfigurationCheckOperations` reports per application
//! ([`RegionState::configuration_check_operations_for`]) — in that Region alone, like
//! every other record.
//!
//! WHICH checks there are to run is the service's own catalogue rather than an account's
//! record: [`configuration_check_definitions`] is the set `ListConfigurationCheckDefinitions`
//! reports and the set [`configuration_checks_to_run`] starts when a request names no
//! check, so the two cannot disagree about what this service supports. Both read the
//! check's prose from the one [`CONFIGURATION_CHECK_CATALOGUE`] every
//! `ConfigurationCheckOperation` names its check with.
//!
//! The record is the stored half; the wire half (`Application`, `ApplicationSummary`,
//! `Operation`, `ConfigurationCheckOperation`, `ComponentSummary`) is PROJECTED from it
//! by [`StoredApplication::view`] / [`StoredApplication::summary`] /
//! [`StoredOperation::view`] / [`StoredConfigurationCheckOperation::view`] /
//! [`StoredComponent::summary`], so no handler assembles a response member by hand.
//!
//! An application's SAP HANA databases are DERIVED from that same record rather than
//! held beside it: the emulator discovers nothing on the registered instances, so the
//! databases an application has are the ones its registration named — by `DatabaseArn`
//! or by a credential's `DatabaseName`
//! ([`StoredApplication::databases`], projected onto the wire `DatabaseSummary` by
//! [`ApplicationDatabase::summary`]) — which is what `ListDatabases` reports, so a
//! database cannot outlive the registration it came from. `GetDatabase` reads ONE of
//! those same records, resolved by its ARN or its `DatabaseId`
//! ([`RegionState::resolve_database`]) and projected onto the wire `Database` by
//! [`StoredApplication::database_view`], so the database a caller reads one by one is the
//! database the listing reports.
//!
//! Those databases are also what ASSOCIATES two registered applications with one
//! another: an application whose SAP HANA connection names the database of another
//! registered application shares that database with it, so each is an associated
//! application of the other. The relation lives between the two records rather than on
//! either, so it is derived from the same database sets
//! ([`RegionState::associated_application_arns`]) at the instant an `Application` is
//! projected ([`RegionState::application_view`]) — which is what
//! `Application$AssociatedApplicationArns` reports, whichever call last set that
//! connection (`RegisterApplication$DatabaseArn`,
//! `UpdateApplicationSettings$DatabaseArn`).
//!
//! The database management system those databases live in is the one thing held BESIDE
//! that record ([`StoredApplication::dbms`]), because the application and its connected
//! DBMS are started and stopped separately: `StopApplication` stops the DBMS only when
//! it names it as the connected entity to stop, so `Database$Status` reports the DBMS's
//! own status ([`StoredDbms::status_for`]) rather than a second reading of the
//! application's.
//!
//! An application's COMPONENTS are held the same way, ON the application rather than in
//! a map of their own (a `ComponentId` names a component only within its application):
//! the [`StoredComponent`] records [`StoredApplication::components`] answers are the ones
//! the service's DISCOVERY of that application produced, so an application whose
//! discovery has not completed has none at all. What a registration describes
//! ([`registered_components`]) — each `ComponentsInfo` entry, plus the SAP HANA component
//! of the SAP system the registration's own `Sid` names, which is the component its
//! databases belong to — is the landscape that discovery finds
//! ([`StoredApplication::described_components`]), not an inventory of components. Each
//! discovered component is projected onto the wire `Component` by
//! [`StoredApplication::component_view`] — which is what `GetComponent` reads back — and
//! onto `ComponentSummary` by [`StoredComponent::summary`], which is what
//! `ListComponents` reports. So a component a caller can read is one discovery produced,
//! every `ComponentId` another response reports is one of them, it reports the status its
//! application is in, and the databases it reports are the ones that registration gave
//! it.
//!
//! What a configuration check RUN produced hangs off that same record: the sub-check
//! results in [`StoredConfigurationCheckOperation::sub_check_results`], each holding the
//! rule results of its own sub-check ([`StoredSubCheckResult::rule_results`]), which is
//! what `ListSubCheckResults` and `ListSubCheckRuleResults` page over. So a result a
//! caller can read is one some run produced, and it is forgotten exactly when the run
//! that produced it is.
//!
//! WHAT a run produces is the EVALUATION of its check's rules against the registered
//! application: [`CONFIGURATION_CHECK_CATALOGUE`] is the sub-checks and
//! [`ConfigurationRule`]s each `ConfigurationCheckType` runs, and each rule reads its
//! status off that application's own record, so the same check passes for one
//! registration and fails for another. The run reaches `SUCCESS` with those results when
//! the clock brings it there, and the `RuleStatusCounts` its record reports are the tally
//! of them ([`StoredConfigurationCheckOperation::rule_status_counts`]) rather than a
//! second copy.
//!
//! What an operation PASSED is derived from that same operation record rather than held
//! beside it: its milestones ([`StoredOperation::events`], projected onto the wire
//! `OperationEvent` by [`OperationEventRecord::view`]) are the start of its work and, once
//! the clock has brought the record to a terminal status, the instant it reached it — so
//! `ListOperationEvents` cannot report a milestone of an operation nobody filed, and the
//! milestones a caller reads move exactly when `GetOperation`'s status does.
//!
//! Resource permissions work the same way: `PutResourcePermission` grants,
//! `DeleteResourcePermission` revokes and `GetResourcePermission` reads the SAME triples in
//! [`RegionState::resource_permissions`],
//! and the `Policy` document all three report is PROJECTED from them by
//! [`RegionState::resource_policy`] — so a grant is observable by every later read in
//! that Region, a revocation disappears from every later read at once, and no handler
//! writes a policy document of its own. The target of a
//! grant is a resource this Region holds ([`RegionState::holds_resource`], the same
//! resolution the tagging calls run), so the policy a read reports always belongs to a
//! resource some registration brought into being, and the grants go when it does.
