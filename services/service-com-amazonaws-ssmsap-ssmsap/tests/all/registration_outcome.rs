//! What a REGISTRATION settles as, and what the calls whose precondition is a working
//! application answer for one that did not settle successfully.
//!
//! Every case goes through the real router (the harness `tests/all/application_lifecycle.rs`
//! owns, with the owner of the instances mounted beside this service where a row needs it
//! — `tests/all/ec2_instance_shutdown.rs` owns that one), so the restJson1 routing, the
//! boundary constraint validation, the handler and the response serialization all run
//! exactly as they do in the emulator binary. Nothing reaches into `crate::state`: a
//! registration's outcome is only believed when `GetApplication` and `GetOperation` report
//! it back.
//!
//! RULE under test: registering an SAP application is asynchronous and what it settles as
//! is the outcome of the DISCOVERY it runs on the Amazon EC2 instances the request named —
//! a Systems Manager document run on each of them. A discovery the owner of those
//! instances lets it carry out leaves the application `ACTIVATED` with a `SUCCESS`
//! discovery and its operation record `SUCCESS`; one it cannot leaves the application
//! `FAILED` with a `REGISTRATION_FAILED` discovery and the record `ERROR` carrying the
//! refusal the inner call answered with. Every call whose precondition is a discovered
//! application then answers that outcome, deterministically and from the application's own
//! state rather than from what else is in flight:
//!
//! * `StartApplication` refuses a FAILED registration with `ValidationException` (400),
//!   naming the application;
//! * `StartApplicationRefresh` and `StartConfigurationChecks` refuse an application that
//!   has not been registered successfully — one still registering as much as one that
//!   failed — with `ConflictException` (409), in fixed text that names nothing of the
//!   request, for EVERY caller whatever order they arrive in;
//! * `StopApplication` is SERVED while a registration is still running, because stopping
//!   an SAP application is no change to what that registration is establishing.
//!
//! Two refusals of the REGISTRATION itself belong to the same slice: a registration that
//! describes an application of another `ApplicationType` than the one it carries is refused
//! with `ValidationException` (400) stating what its type has to specify, and so is one the
//! account has no room for under its Applications quota — which tracks the applications
//! the Region holds at that instant, so deregistering one frees a slot.
//!
//! The rows span what the rules generalise over: whether the owner of the instance holds
//! it and in what state, both lengths the modelled instance-id form admits, which
//! precondition call is made, how many callers race, the application type, the forms the
//! modelled `ApplicationId` admits, and whether a member a type excludes is carried,
//! carried empty or omitted.
