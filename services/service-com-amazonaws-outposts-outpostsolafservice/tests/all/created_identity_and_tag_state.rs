//! End-to-end cover for what a SUCCESS response reports about the resource the call
//! just created or changed, driven over the wire through
//! `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` exactly as a signed `aws outposts` call arrives
//! (reusing the harness of [`crate::site_and_outpost_lifecycle`]).
//!
//! The rules under test, each stated once and then exercised over a SET of inputs:
//!
//! 1. `CreateSite`'s 200 reports the id it minted for the new site at the top level
//!    (`SiteId`) as well as on the `Site` it answers, and both name the SAME site —
//!    the response is the only place a caller learns that id, and every later call
//!    addressed with it (`GetSite`, `CreateOutpost$SiteId`) reaches that site.
//! 2. A success response projects the resource AS STORED, so `UpdateSite`'s 200
//!    carries the tag map the site holds at that moment — including tags a
//!    `TagResource` applied after the create, and excluding ones an `UntagResource`
//!    removed — rather than a tagless projection, and a later read agrees with it.
//! 3. A tag mutation (`TagResource`, `UntagResource`) reports nothing back about the
//!    resource it changed — its output declares no member — so it answers
//!    [`TAG_MUTATION_SUCCESS_STATUS`] with no member in the body, while the change
//!    itself is visible to the next read.
