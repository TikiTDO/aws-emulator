//! The entitlements an accepted agreement grants, read back from the services
//! that OWN them, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! Every assertion here goes through one router carrying three services over one
//! shared engine — the agreement service, the AWS Marketplace Entitlement
//! Service and AWS License Manager — so each case exercises routing,
//! deserialization, the handlers, the persisted state and serialization, the
//! same path a client takes.
//!
//! The rule under test: an entitlement an accepted agreement grants is a
//! resource of the services that own it, so it exists THERE while the agreement
//! that granted it is active. The seller's `GetEntitlements` reports it for the
//! product code of the resource it was provisioned to, keyed by the buyer's
//! account, carrying the capacity each dimension of the agreement was bought at
//! and the agreement's end date as `ExpirationDate` ("the date at which the
//! customer will renew or cancel their contract"); `AgreementEntitlement`'s
//! `licenseArn` ("the ARN of the AWS License Manager license associated with the
//! entitlement") names a licence `GetLicense` resolves, valid over the
//! agreement's own window. An agreement that is no longer active entitles its
//! acceptor to nothing: its records stop being reported and its licence is no
//! longer available.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: how many dimensions the
//! accepted terms configure (none, one, two), whether a key is configured twice,
//! which contract length was purchased, how large the purchased quantity is,
//! whether the dimension is one the published rate card prices at all, which
//! product of the offer the entitlement is for, and which way the agreement
//! later stopped being active.
//!
//! The agreement-side harness (`accept`, `agreement_over`, `call`, `cancel`,
//! `create`, `describe`, `term`, `upfront_term`) is the one `agreement_lifecycle`
//! owns, and the aging step is the one `agreement_expiry` owns.
