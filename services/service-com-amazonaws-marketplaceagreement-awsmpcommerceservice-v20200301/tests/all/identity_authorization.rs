//! WHO may reach this service, driven over the real wire path (an awsJson1_0 request
//! through the multi-service router into this service mounted beside IAM and STS on one
//! shared engine), so what is asserted is what a client sees.
//!
//! RULE. AWS takes IAM's decision in FRONT of the service, so a request is served only
//! where the identity-based policies in force on the principal its credentials name allow
//! one of the actions that PERMIT the operation — `aws-marketplace:<OperationName>`, and
//! for an operation that only reports an account's agreements the coarse
//! `aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions` as well; a request no statement allows, or one an
//! explicit `Deny` covers, is refused with the modelled `AccessDeniedException`
//! (`@httpError(403)`, a service-common error of this model, so every operation declares
//! it) BEFORE the store is read — so the refusal does not depend on what the request names,
//! and an unauthorized caller cannot tell from it whether the agreement it named exists.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: the OPERATION asked for (a read of one
//! agreement, the create that mints a quote, a listing, a mutation, and the one operation
//! whose own answer is a modelled refusal), the DOCUMENT in force on the principal (none at
//! all, another service's actions only, another action of this service only, an allow of
//! exactly the action, an allow of the whole service, an allow of everything beside an
//! explicit deny — the shape a scoped-down role carries), and the CREDENTIAL (an
//! assumed-role session, the account's own published key). The refusal's sentence is
//! asserted whole, with every part — principal, action, resource, reason — taken from the
//! request and the stored policy.
//!
//! The principals are made with IAM's and STS's OWN operations over the same engine
//! (`CreateRole` + `PutRolePolicy` + `AssumeRole`, `DeleteRolePolicy`), so the documents
//! this service reads are the ones those services wrote; the decision itself is
//! `service_common::iam_authorization`, shared with every other service that authorizes.
