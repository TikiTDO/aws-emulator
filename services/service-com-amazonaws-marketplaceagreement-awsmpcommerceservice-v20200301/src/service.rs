//! The `com-amazonaws-marketplaceagreement-awsmpcommerceservice-v20200301` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Five opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. Return `Some(op)` to route one yourself.
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording. See the inline note on that method for how to reword.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## How a refused request is stated
//!
//! This service models its own `ValidationException`, and that shape carries
//! `reason` (a `ValidationExceptionReason`) and `fields` (entries of
//! `{name, message}`) beside `message`. The framework validates every modelled
//! constraint — `DescribeAgreementInput$agreementId` has a pattern and a length,
//! `MaxResults` a range, `FilterList` a length, … — BEFORE any handler runs, and
//! renders a violation in the protocol's generic refusal body, which carries
//! `message` alone: `Service::override_refusal` chooses only a code and a
//! message, so the modelled members cannot be stated through it at all.
//!
//! [`ModelledValidation`] is therefore interposed in front of EVERY modelled
//! operation: it reads the violations the boundary walk would find and, when
//! there are any, answers them as this service's own `ValidationException`
//! through [`crate::state::validation_exception_for`] — the same rendering the
//! handlers' own refusals use, so one refused member reads alike wherever it was
//! found. A request with no violation is handed to the generated walk unchanged.
//!
//! ## The authorization layer every operation runs under
//!
//! AWS decides authorization at the IAM layer, in FRONT of the service: a caller
//! whose identity-based policies do not allow the action it asked for is refused
//! before the request's own input is looked at and before anything is read or
//! written. So that decision is taken for EVERY operation of this service, in
//! [`Authorized`] — which fronts [`ModelledValidation`] in the one table
//! [`Service::override_operation`] serves this service's operations through — and
//! nowhere else. [`authorization`] holds the store lookups and the sentence.
//!
//! ## What every call publishes once it has been answered
//!
//! The entitlements an accepted agreement grants are resources of two OTHER
//! services — the Marketplace Entitlement Service holds the product entitlement
//! a seller reads, and License Manager the licence an entitlement names — so
//! they are published there rather than only reported from here
//! ([`crate::state::granted_entitlements`]). That publication follows the
//! agreements' status and the clock, which an acceptance, an amendment, a
//! cancellation, a replacement, an expiry and a renewal all move, so it is made
//! in [`Authorized`] after every call this service answers instead of from each
//! handler: one place, which no handler can forget, and which the clock-owed
//! transitions a reporting operation materialises reach as well.
