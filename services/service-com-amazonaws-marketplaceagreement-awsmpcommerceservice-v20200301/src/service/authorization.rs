//! Whether IAM lets a request to this service perform the action it asks for — the
//! decision taken in FRONT of every operation, before it reads or writes anything.
//!
//! Every operation of this service is signed (`smithy_query(query="service_info")`:
//! `authSchemes: [sigv4]`, and the model marks none `@optionalAuth`), so every call is
//! made by a principal — and a principal may only do what a policy in force on it ALLOWS.
//! AWS takes that decision at the IAM layer, AHEAD of the service looking at what the
//! request names, so a caller whose identity-based policies do not grant the action — or
//! that an explicit `Deny` covers — is told it is not authorized rather than told anything
//! about the resource it addressed: the refusal comes before the store is read, so a
//! request for an agreement that does not exist is refused the same way as one for an
//! agreement that does, and nothing of the account changes on the way to it.
//!
//! This service models that refusal as `AccessDeniedException` (`@httpError(403)`), which
//! is a SERVICE-COMMON error of its model (`smithy_query(query="digest")` lists it under
//! `common_errors`), so it is the answer every one of its operations gives such a caller.
//! The decision is therefore taken for EVERY operation rather than for the few whose
//! handler asks for it: it is a property of the request's identity and the action it names
//! rather than of what the handler goes on to do, so it is taken ONCE, in the layer every
//! operation of this service is already served behind
//! ([`crate::service::EmulatedService::override_operation`]), and nowhere else.
//!
//! Three pieces, each held in exactly one place:
//!
//! 1. **who** — the principal the request's access key id speaks for: the session STS
//!    minted that key for ([`sts_store::resolve_caller`], the same place
//!    `sts:GetCallerIdentity` answers from, so the principal a refusal blames is the one
//!    the caller reads back for the credentials it signed with), else the IAM user that
//!    owns the long-term key, else the account's own published credential;
//! 2. **what it may do** — the identity-based policy documents the IAM store holds for
//!    that principal and the permissions boundary that caps them, read through the IAM
//!    service's OWN accessors (`principal_policies`, `permissions_boundary_document`),
//!    where the collection rule itself lives — so a document `iam:PutRolePolicy` wrote
//!    takes effect on the next request and deleting it lifts it again;
//! 3. **the decision** — [`::service_common::iam_authorization`], the tree's ONE evaluation
//!    of those documents against `(action, resource)`, so this service and every other one
//!    handed the same documents answer alike: an explicit `Deny` wins, otherwise an `Allow`
//!    about the request grants it, and with neither the request falls to IAM's default
//!    deny.
//!
//! Only the store LOOKUPS live here; neither the decision nor the reading of a principal
//! ARN does. That is the split every other gate in this tree makes, and the lookups stay in
//! this service crate for the reason those keep theirs there: hoisting them into
//! `service-common` would make every service that depends on that crate link the IAM and
//! STS service crates.
//!
//! ## The actions and the resource
//!
//! The action an operation is performed under is `aws-marketplace:<OperationName>` — this
//! service's `sigv4Name` / `arnNamespace` ([`crate::state::SERVICE_CODE`],
//! `smithy_query(query="service_info")`) and the operation's own shape name — so one policy
//! statement scoped to this service's actions covers every operation of it and nothing
//! outside it. That is the action a refusal says the caller may not PERFORM.
//!
//! An operation may be PERMITTED by more than one action, though: AWS Marketplace grants
//! the view of an account's agreements through the coarse `aws-marketplace:ViewSubscriptions`
//! as well as through the per-API action, so the decision is taken over the SET of actions
//! that permit the operation ([`actions_for`]) rather than over one action — an `Allow` of
//! any of them grants the call, and IAM's "an explicit deny wins" is read over that same
//! set, so a `Deny` of any action the decision was taken over refuses it. Because a
//! refusal over a set is attributable to no single action, AWS states it in one sentence
//! that names the whole set and neither rule (see [`identity_denial_clause`]); an operation
//! only its own action permits keeps IAM's single-action wording. Whichever action granted
//! or refused it, the sentence blames the caller for the action the operation is PERFORMED
//! under, which is the one it asked for.
//!
//! The resource is [`ANY_RESOURCE`], IAM's own resource wildcard, for every operation: the
//! AWS Marketplace actions these operations are performed under take no resource type (the
//! IAM Service Authorization Reference lists none for them), so a statement allows one only
//! by covering every resource — and the refusal names that resource, which is what the
//! request addressed as far as IAM is concerned. Nothing of the request's own body is read
//! here, which is what keeps the decision independent of whether the agreement it names
//! exists.
//!
//! ## The callers this gate does not bound
//!
//! * **The account's own published credential.** A request whose access key id neither STS
//!   nor IAM holds a record for resolves to the account's own identity, which is not a
//!   principal the IAM store holds policies for — the position AWS account root
//!   credentials are in. Such a request is allowed.
//! * **A principal holding an attachment this emulator cannot read.** An AWS-managed policy
//!   belongs to AWS rather than to this account, so the IAM store holds no document for it;
//!   refusing on a grant this emulator cannot see would deny access AWS permits. An
//!   explicit `Deny` in a document that CAN be read still refuses, and a permissions
//!   boundary the store DOES hold still caps the grant.
//! * **An engine carrying no STS or IAM store**, where no session and no role can exist.
//!
//! An expired session credential speaks for nobody: it carries no documents and no
//! principal spelling, so every action it asks for is refused. (A session the
//! authenticating layer has already refused never reaches a handler at all.)
