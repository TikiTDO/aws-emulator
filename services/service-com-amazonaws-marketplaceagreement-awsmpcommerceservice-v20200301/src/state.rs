//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-marketplaceagreement-awsmpcommerceservice-v20200301 service.
//!
//! Three resources carry the agreement lifecycle this crate serves:
//!
//! * an **agreement request** — "a quote for the terms you want to accept"
//!   (`CreateAgreementRequest`), which captures the requested terms and the
//!   charges they imply;
//! * an **agreement** — what `AcceptAgreementRequest` finalises from one of
//!   those requests, or, where the request amends an existing agreement
//!   ("`AMEND` – Modifies an existing agreement with terms that are accepted in
//!   the request"), the agreement that accept re-states ([`Agreement::amend`]),
//!   and what the clock creates again at the end date of one
//!   whose accepted terms renew it there
//!   ([`ComAmazonawsMarketplaceagreementAwsmpcommerceserviceV20200301State::settle_agreement`]),
//!   and what `DescribeAgreement`, `GetAgreementTerms`,
//!   `SearchAgreements` and `CancelAgreement` report on and mutate. Accepting it
//!   also provisions the **entitlements** it grants, which belong to the
//!   agreement rather than standing on their own and which
//!   `GetAgreementEntitlements` reports;
//! * a **payment request** — what `SendAgreementPaymentRequest` submits under an
//!   agreement's `VariablePaymentTerm`, and what
//!   `ListAgreementPaymentRequests` reports;
//! * a **billing adjustment request** — what
//!   `BatchCreateBillingAdjustmentRequest` submits against one invoice of an
//!   agreement, and what `GetBillingAdjustmentRequest` and
//!   `ListBillingAdjustmentRequests` report on;
//! * an **invoice** — what the acceptance of an agreement issues for each
//!   charge it bills ([`Invoice`]), what `ListAgreementInvoiceLineItems`
//!   reports grouped by invoice, and what an adjustment entry is resolved
//!   against.
//!
//! Every projection the model asks for (`DescribeAgreementOutput`,
//! `AgreementViewSummary`, `ChargeSummary`, `AcceptedTerm`,
//! `BillingAdjustmentSummary`) is computed from these records, so the
//! implemented operations share exactly one copy of each resource.
//!
//! ## Where the money comes from
//!
//! An agreement request names terms that live in an *agreement proposal* (an
//! offer), which is a resource of a different AWS Marketplace API and is not in
//! this service's model or state — so there is no per-proposal term document or
//! rate card to read here. What this emulator holds instead is an offer of its
//! OWN, as DATA: [`RATE_CARD`] publishes the per-unit price of each product
//! dimension it carries, at each contract length, [`TERM_PRICE_LIST`] the single
//! price of each kind of term that carries one instead of a rate card,
//! [`OFFER_RESOURCES`] the products the offer is for (the resources an agreement
//! accepted from it is involved with, and the ones its entitlements are
//! provisioned to), and
//! [`OFFER_DOCUMENT`] what each kind of term proposes beyond those prices (its
//! documents, policy text, durations, grants and ceilings). A quote prices the
//! dimensions and terms those lists publish — quantity times the published rate
//! — and reports NO amount for anything they do not, which
//! `ExpectedCharge$amount` ("Only available when the charge amount is known")
//! states, and the accepted terms an acceptance stores are the terms of that
//! same document ([`accepted_term`]). Nothing here derives a price: a rate card
//! is data.
//!
//! Each amount is computed ONCE, by the quote
//! ([`ComAmazonawsMarketplaceagreementAwsmpcommerceserviceV20200301State::charge_summary`]),
//! so the agreement that accepting the quote mints and the charges that
//! agreement holds read that one copy rather than pricing again.
//!
//! Two charged kinds are never priced at quote time whatever the lists carry: a
//! usage-based charge is "based on product usage", and a variable payment is an
//! amount no seller has requested yet. The agreement value of terms that commit
//! nothing at all is `EstimatedCharges$agreementValue`'s documented zero
//! ([`ZERO_AGREEMENT_VALUE`]), and it is absent when a term commits an amount
//! these lists do not price. `ChargeSummary`'s tax members and its
//! `invoicingEntity` stay absent: AWS estimates tax from the acceptor's tax
//! registration and address and invoices through the entity that address
//! belongs to, none of which this service models, and the model returns those
//! members "on a best-effort basis".
