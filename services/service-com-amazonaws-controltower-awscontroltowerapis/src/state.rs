//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-controltower-awscontroltowerapis service.
//!
//! The landing zone is Control Tower's primary resource and AWS allows exactly ONE per
//! account, so [`ComAmazonawsControltowerAwscontroltowerapisState::landing_zones`] holds
//! at most one entry and the one-per-account rule is read off its size rather than from a
//! separate flag. Decommissioning it "deletes Amazon Web Services Control Tower resources
//! deployed in accounts managed by Amazon Web Services Control Tower", so the enablements
//! those resources are do not outlive it: applying a decommissioning empties
//! `enabled_controls` and `enabled_baselines` too (see [`settle`]).
//!
//! Landing zone operations are a log keyed by `operationIdentifier`: a record outlives
//! the landing zone it acted on, so `GetLandingZoneOperation` still resolves the
//! identifier a `DeleteLandingZone` returned.
//!
//! Baselines work the same way one level down: an `EnabledBaseline` is a baseline applied
//! to a target, and `EnableBaseline`/`UpdateEnabledBaseline`/`DisableBaseline` each start
//! an asynchronous operation whose record lands in a SECOND log keyed by `operationIdentifier`
//! ([`ComAmazonawsControltowerAwscontroltowerapisState::baseline_operations`]), which
//! `GetBaselineOperation` resolves. The two logs are separate: an identifier a landing
//! zone call returned is not a baseline operation and vice versa.
//!
//! Control enablement keeps a log of its own, the same shape one level down again: a call
//! that enables, updates, resets or disables a control starts an asynchronous operation
//! whose record lands in
//! [`ComAmazonawsControltowerAwscontroltowerapisState::control_operations`], keyed by
//! `operationIdentifier` and resolved by `GetControlOperation`/`ListControlOperations`.
//! It is a THIRD separate log: an identifier a landing zone or baseline call returned is
//! not a control operation, and vice versa.
//!
//! The baseline CATALOG is a third kind of data: the baselines themselves are AWS-managed
//! and identical in every account, so they live in the constant [`BASELINE_CATALOG`] that
//! `GetBaseline` resolves an identifier against, not in the per-account store. No call
//! creates, changes or deletes a baseline, so nothing a caller does can grow it.
//!
//! CONTROLS are catalog data of exactly that kind: a control is AWS-managed and identical
//! in every account, so the controls a caller may name live in the constant
//! [`CONTROL_CATALOG`] that `EnableControl` resolves a `controlIdentifier` against, and no
//! call creates, changes or deletes one either.
//!
//! RETENTION: every store a caller can grow by repeating calls is BOUNDED, so ordinary
//! request traffic cannot grow this process's heap, or the per-request scan [`settle`]
//! runs under the state lock, without limit:
//!
//! * `landing_zones` holds the one landing zone an account may have;
//! * the three operation logs are append-only only WITHIN a bound, retaining at most
//!   [`MAX_LANDING_ZONE_OPERATIONS`] / [`MAX_BASELINE_OPERATIONS`] /
//!   [`MAX_CONTROL_OPERATIONS`] records and evicting the oldest TERMINAL record to make
//!   room (see [`enforce_log_bound`]);
//!
//! A log whose operations document how long an operation's details stay available is
//! bounded by that window as well, and the window is the stronger rule: a record older
//! than [`OPERATION_DETAILS_AVAILABLE_FOR`] is dropped by [`settle`], so every call that
//! reports one — the by-identifier read and the listing alike — answers the same way
//! about the same record rather than each handler testing the age itself.
//! * `enabled_baselines` holds at most [`MAX_ENABLED_BASELINES`] enablements, and
//!   `EnableBaseline` is REFUSED past that cap rather than growing the store (see
//!   [`record_enablement`]), because an enablement is a resource a caller must tear down
//!   rather than a history record a newer one may evict;
//! * `enabled_controls` holds at most [`MAX_ENABLED_CONTROLS`] control enablements — one
//!   per control/target pair, whether `EnableControl` was called for it or the service
//!   applied it to a target brought under its governance ([`apply_governance_controls`]) —
//!   and `EnableControl` is REFUSED past that cap for the same reason as `EnableBaseline`,
//!   while a service-applied control is simply not written past it;
//! * `tags` is keyed by the ARNs of the stores above, and an entry is dropped with the
//!   resource it tags, so it is bounded by them; one resource's tag map holds at most
//!   [`MAX_TAGS_PER_RESOURCE`] entries and `TagResource` is REFUSED past that count (see
//!   [`merge_tags`]), so repeating it with fresh keys cannot grow the store either, and
//!   [`remove_tags`] only ever shrinks it.
//!
//! The LIST operations over these stores all narrow their listing the same way, so the
//! rule lives here once rather than in each handler: [`Filter`] is one `filter` member as
//! a handler matches it, [`filter_set`] turns a sent member into that set and
//! [`selected`]/[`selected_optional`] test one stored record against it. Every list
//! operation of this crate reaches the rule through these, so narrowing by a filter
//! member cannot drift between them.
//!
//! They all PAGINATE the listing they narrowed the same way as well, so that rule lives
//! here once for the same reason: [`page`] cuts out the page a `nextToken`/`maxResults`
//! pair asks for and hands back the token that resumes the listing after it, and
//! [`TokenScope`] says how far a token one listing handed out reaches — a listing the
//! request narrows carries the parameters it was narrowed by ([`ListingKey`]), so its
//! token resumes only a call that repeats them. Every list operation of this crate
//! reaches the rule through [`page`], so a page boundary — and the refusal of a token no
//! page of that listing handed out — cannot drift between them either.
//!
//! A resource reported by BOTH a Get and a List operation projects its stored drift onto
//! the modelled drift summary here once, for the same reason: [`EnabledBaseline::drift_status_summary`]
//! is the `driftStatusSummary` an enabled baseline reports and
//! [`EnabledControl::drift_status_summary`] the one an enabled control reports. Both
//! reporting operations of each resource kind read the member through its projection, so
//! which stored status becomes which reported member — and whether the member is reported
//! at all — cannot drift between the detail and the listing.
//!
//! The enablement calls share one PRECONDITION, so it lives here once as well: Control
//! Tower serves them for an account it has been set up in, and [`is_set_up`] is that
//! question asked of the stores above. An account it has provisioned nothing in has no
//! landing zone and no service role for a call to reach enablement state through, so each
//! such READ refuses rather than reporting out of its empty store, and each call that would
//! enable, update, re-deploy or disable a control or a baseline refuses rather than writing
//! an enablement into it — in the words its resource family uses,
//! [`SETUP_REQUIRED_FOR_BASELINES`] for the baseline enablement calls and
//! [`SETUP_REQUIRED_FOR_CONTROLS`] for the control enablement and control-operation ones.
