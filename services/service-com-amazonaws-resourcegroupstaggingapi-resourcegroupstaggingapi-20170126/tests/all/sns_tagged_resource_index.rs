//! Amazon SNS as an OWNING service of this API: a topic holds its own tag set, so
//! that set — not a second copy here — is what `GetResources` reports, what
//! `TagResources` writes and what `UntagResources` removes from, and a well-formed
//! topic ARN that service holds no topic for is this ARN's own
//! `FailedResourcesMap` entry carrying THAT service's refusal rather than a
//! silently created resource.
//!
//! Every test drives the real wire path over ONE engine carrying both services,
//! which is how the emulator runs: `POST /` with an `X-Amz-Target` and an awsJson
//! body for this API, and an awsQuery form body for Amazon SNS.
//!
//! The tables span the class the rule generalises over: a topic that was never
//! created, one whose name only resembles a live one, a FIFO topic, and one the
//! owning service DELETED after it had been tagged — and, on the writing side, how
//! many tags the request carries, a tag with an empty value, and which of the two
//! APIs wrote them.
