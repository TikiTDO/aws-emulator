//! `CreateStudio` names an Amazon EC2 VPC, the subnets the Studio's Workspaces run in, the

//! resource of this service: the network objects live in Amazon EC2 and the role in IAM, and

//! ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext::callback`]), so this crate names no other

//! is the ONE answer to which VPCs, subnets and security groups the account has.
//!
//! Every refusal built here is grounded in what the other service ANSWERED. An emulator
//! with no EC2 or no IAM mounted knows nothing about the network or the role, and nothing is
//! what it refuses on: a Studio GATES on existence and keeps nothing of the network, so
//! silence costs the create nothing to skip, and a refusal assumed from it would be
