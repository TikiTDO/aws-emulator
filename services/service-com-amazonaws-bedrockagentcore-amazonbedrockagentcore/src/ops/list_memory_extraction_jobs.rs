//! @op ListMemoryExtractionJobs
//! Reports the units of long-term memory extraction work a memory container holds — the
//! extraction jobs eligible to be started — computed from what that container has
//! accepted for extraction.
//!
//! The rule: one job per SESSION of one actor, composed of the messages that session's
//! records carry for long-term extraction — the conversational turns of the events
//! `CreateEvent` stored in it (an event created with `extractionMode` `SKIP` is excluded
//! from extraction, so it composes none) and of the content `IngestData` submitted into
//! it — each message named by the id of the record it belongs to and its position in
//! that record's messages; a session composing no message is no unit of work and is not
//! reported. The optional `filter` narrows the list by every member it carries at once,
//! and the page is bounded by `maxResults` with an opaque `nextToken` resuming after it.
//! Nothing is reported about an extraction ATTEMPT: no `status`, no `failureReason`.
//!
//! The derivation itself lives beside the store it reads
//! ([`crate::state::ComAmazonawsBedrockagentcoreAmazonbedrockagentcoreState::extraction_job_units`]),
//! so the `jobId` this listing reports and the unit it stands for have one home.
//!
//! This operation only REPORTS: it writes nothing, so two listings of an unchanged
//! container answer the same.

//! # Modeled contract for `ListMemoryExtractionJobs`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-bedrockagentcore-amazonbedrockagentcore/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-bedrockagentcore-amazonbedrockagentcore.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Lists all long-term memory extraction jobs that are eligible to be started with optional
//! filtering. To use this operation, you must have the
//! bedrock-agentcore:ListMemoryExtractionJobs permission.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `filter` (ExtractionJobFilterInput) — Filter criteria to apply when listing extraction
//!   jobs.
//! * `maxResults` (Integer, default 20) **required** — The maximum number of results to
//!   return in a single call. The default value is 20.
//! * `memoryId` (MemoryId, len 12.., pattern
//!   ^(arn:(aws|aws-cn|aws-us-gov):bedrock-agentcore:[a-z0-9-]+:[0-9]{12}:memory/)?[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-_]{0,99}-[a-zA-Z0-9]{10
//!   …) **required** — The unique identifier of the memory to list extraction jobs for.
//! * `nextToken` (PaginationToken) — The token for the next set of results. Use the value
//!   returned in the previous response in the next request to retrieve the next set of
//!   results.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `jobs` (ExtractionJobMetadataList) **required** — List of extraction job metadata
//!   matching the specified criteria.
//! * `nextToken` (PaginationToken) — Token to retrieve the next page of results, if
//!   available.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `AccessDeniedException` (HTTP 403) — The exception that occurs when you do not have
//!   sufficient permissions to perform an action. Verify that your IAM policy includes the
//!   necessary permissions for the operation you are trying to perform.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — The exception that occurs when the specified
//!   resource does not exist. This can happen when using an invalid identifier or when trying
//!   to access a resource that has been deleted.
//! * `ServiceException` (HTTP 500) — The service encountered an internal error. Try your
//!   request again later.
//! * `ServiceQuotaExceededException` (HTTP 402) — The exception that occurs when the request
//!   would cause a service quota to be exceeded. Review your service quotas and either reduce
//!   your request rate or request a quota increase.
//! * `ThrottledException` (HTTP 429) — The request was denied due to request throttling.
//!   Reduce the frequency of requests and try again.
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — The exception that occurs when the input fails to
//!   satisfy the constraints specified by the service. Check the error message for details
//!   about which input parameter is invalid and correct your request.
