//! End-to-end tests for a `Task` state's service integration, driven over both
//! services' own wire protocols through the production `MultiServiceRouter` with
//! Step Functions and DynamoDB mounted on ONE engine — the shape
//! `core/router/src/lib.rs` mounts them in — so what is asserted is what a signed
//! AWS SDK request observes, including the FAR-END effect of the call the task
//! made.
//!
//! The rule under test: a `Task` state whose `Resource` names a service integration
//! performs that service's own API operation, with the document the state built (its
//! `Parameters` payload template over its effective input, or that input itself) as
//! the operation's REQUEST and the operation's response document as the state's
//! RESULT — so the execution's far-end effect is really there afterwards, read back
//! through that service's own API; and a call the service REFUSED is the task's own
//! failure, named `<the service's SDK id>.<the error code it answered>`, which the
//! state's `Retry` and `Catch` match on.
//!
//! The recorded case this suite's issue was filed about — an event-driven execution
//! whose only state is an `arn:aws:states:::dynamodb:putItem` task writing a key
//! taken from the execution input — is ONE row of the first table.
//!
//! What no call is made for is still not faked: the last table pins that each such
//! `Resource` ends the execution `FAILED` with ASL's `States.Runtime` and a cause
//! that says what was not run.
