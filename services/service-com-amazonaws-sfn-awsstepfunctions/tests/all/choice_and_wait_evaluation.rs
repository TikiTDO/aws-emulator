//! End-to-end tests for how the Amazon States Language's `Choice` comparators and
//! `Wait` members are EVALUATED at run time, driven over this service's own wire
//! protocol (`awsJson1_0`, `POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: AWSStepFunctions.<Operation>`)
//! through the production `MultiServiceRouter`.
//!
//! Four rules are under test, each over a table whose rows differ along what the rule
//! generalises over rather than along the one input an issue cited:
//!
//! 1. A typed comparator is TYPE-STRICT and never coerces: it matches only a candidate
//!    whose JSON type is the comparator's own, and a candidate of any other type simply
//!    does not match, so evaluation falls through to the next rule and finally to the
//!    state's `Default`. The rows cross every comparator family (`String*`, `Numeric*`,
//!    `BooleanEquals`, `Timestamp*`, `StringMatches`, each in its `*Path` form too) with
//!    every JSON type a candidate can have (string, number, boolean, null, array,
//!    object), and run the mismatch inside `And`/`Or`/`Not` as well.
//! 2. A timestamp comparator compares the INSTANTS its operands denote, not their
//!    lexical text: the whole ISO 8601 instant grammar is read, a numeric UTC offset
//!    included, so two spellings of one instant compare equal and a lexically larger
//!    string can denote the earlier instant.
//! 3. A `Choice` rule's condition path that resolves to nothing fails the execution with
//!    `States.Runtime`, and the cause names THAT path, so the failing operand is told
//!    from every other path the state reads.
//! 4. A state member whose value is not one the member accepts fails with a cause that
//!    names the member THE DEFINITION WROTE — `SecondsPath` where the definition carries
//!    a `SecondsPath` — and never the other member of the pair.
//!
//! The harness (`Emulator`, `create_machine`, `start_execution`, `describe_execution`,
//! `string`) is the one `state_machine_lifecycle` builds and the `Choice` definition is
//! `execution_interpreter`'s; `tests/all.rs` is this binary's crate root, so both are
//! reached through `crate::<suite>`.
