//! @op UpdatePlan
//!
//! Writes the plan's mutable configuration from the request and answers with the plan
//! read back from the store, so what the caller sees is what a later `GetPlan` reads.
//!
//! Every member a Region switch plan lets a caller change is a member of this request
//! (`description`, `workflows`, `executionRole`, `recoveryTimeObjectiveMinutes`,
//! `associatedAlarms`, `triggers`, `reportConfiguration`, `serviceQuotaChecksEnabled` —
//! each `@cfnMutability: full`), so the request carries the plan's whole mutable
//! configuration and the update REPLACES it: an omitted optional member leaves the plan
//! without that configuration rather than keeping what was there before. The plan's
//! identity and topology (`arn`, `name`, `regions`, `recoveryApproach`, `primaryRegion`,
//! `owner`) is not a member of this request and is left untouched.
//!
//! The server-owned `version` and `updatedAt` move with the write: `version` is derived
//! from the record's revision (`crate::state::StoredPlan::version`), which this handler
//! bumps once per accepted update, and `updatedAt` becomes the instant of the write.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request. Reach
//! the store through [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the
//! guard it hands back. `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries
//! request metadata only; the engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `UpdatePlan`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-arcregionswitch-arcregionswitch/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-arcregionswitch-arcregionswitch.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Updates an existing Region switch plan. You can modify the plan's description,
//! workflows, execution role, recovery time objective, associated alarms, and triggers.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `arn` (PlanArn, pattern
//!   ^arn:aws[a-zA-Z-]*:arc-region-switch::[0-9]{12}:plan/([a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,30}[a-zA-Z0-9])?):([a-z0-9]{6})$)
//!   **required** — The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the plan.
//! * `associatedAlarms` (AssociatedAlarmMap) — The updated CloudWatch alarms associated with
//!   the plan.
//! * `description` (String) — The updated description for the Region switch plan.
//! * `executionRole` (IamRoleArn, pattern ^arn:aws[a-zA-Z0-9-]*:iam::[0-9]{12}:role/.+$)
//!   **required** — The updated IAM role ARN that grants Region switch the permissions needed
//!   to execute the plan steps.
//! * `recoveryTimeObjectiveMinutes` (Integer) — The updated target recovery time objective
//!   (RTO) in minutes for the plan.
//! * `reportConfiguration` (ReportConfiguration) — The updated report configuration for the
//!   plan.
//! * `serviceQuotaChecksEnabled` (Boolean) — Specifies whether service quota checks are
//!   enabled for the Region switch plan.
//! * `triggers` (TriggerList) — The updated conditions that can automatically trigger the
//!   execution of the plan.
//! * `workflows` (WorkflowList) **required** — The updated workflows for the Region switch
//!   plan.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `plan` (Plan) — The details of the updated Region switch plan.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — The specified resource was not found. HTTP
//!   Status Code: 404
