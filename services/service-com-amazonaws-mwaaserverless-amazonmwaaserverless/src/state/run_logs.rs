//! Where a run's own execution output GOES: the CloudWatch Logs log group the workflow's
//! `LoggingConfiguration` names.
//!
//! A workflow that configures logging asks this service to export what its runs produce —
//! "Logs are automatically exported to your specified CloudWatch log group using remote
//! logging functionality" over output that "capture[s] workflow execution details,
//! task-level information, and system events" (`smithy_query(query="doc",
//! shape="LoggingConfiguration")`), into the group `LogGroupName` names ("The name of the
//! CloudWatch log group where workflow execution logs are stored"). So a client that
//! configures a group and then asks CloudWatch Logs for it (`DescribeLogGroups`,
//! `DescribeLogStreams`, `GetLogEvents`) has to FIND the run's output there, and the stream
//! each task instance wrote to is the one `GetTaskInstance` reports as `LogStream` ("The
//! CloudWatch log stream name for this task instance execution") — a reported stream name
//! that names nothing would be a resource no reader can reach.
//!
//! What is exported is what this emulator's own orchestration PRODUCED and the store holds:
//! the run's admission and each status the clock moved it to, and, per task instance, the
//! attempt starting and the outcome it ended with ([`crate::state::WorkflowRun::settle`]).
//! Nothing else is invented: what a task's operator does to the resources it names is the
//! operator's own work against another service, which this emulator does not perform, so no
//! output is written for it.
//!
//! ## How it travels
//!
//! A line is QUEUED on the run it belongs to at the instant the transition that produced it
//! is materialised ([`crate::state::WorkflowRun::pending_log_lines`]) and DELIVERED by the
//! call that materialised it, once that call has released this service's store
//! ([`publish`]) — so the two stores are never locked at once and the work that produces a
//! line stays a pure store transition. A line a store write queued with no handler of its
//! own to deliver it — the admission of a run a workflow's trigger fired — stays on that run
//! until the next call that settles it takes it, so it is delivered rather than lost. The
//! queue is bounded ([`MAX_PENDING_LOG_LINES`]), which is what holds the wait between the
//! write that produces a line and the call that takes it to a fixed size per run.
//!
//! An engine with no CloudWatch Logs store mounted has nowhere for a line to go, so the
//! call that takes it drops it ([`publish`]) rather than keeping it for a reader that cannot
//! exist: nothing accumulates there either.
//!
//! The events are written into the CloudWatch Logs service's OWN store in the SAME shared
//! engine, through that service's own record constructors
//! ([`logs::LogGroupRecord::new`], [`logs::LogStreamRecord::new`]) and under its own
//! ceilings, so what this service exported is what CloudWatch Logs' own readers report.
//! They do not travel over `logs:PutLogEvents`: that API refuses a group or a stream the
//! account does not hold yet, while the remote-logging export this service documents is
//! what CREATES the group and the streams it writes to.
