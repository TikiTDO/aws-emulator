//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-mwaaserverless-amazonmwaaserverless service.
//!
//! The store holds the workflow control plane — the workflows a caller created, the
//! immutable versions of each one, and the runs started under them — plus the
//! idempotency ledger that lets a repeated `ClientToken` replay its first answer.
//! Every handler reads and writes THIS struct through [`service_state`]; nothing in
//! `src/ops/` keeps a store of its own.
//!
//! The store is PARTITIONED BY REGION: a workflow belongs to the endpoint it was
//! created through ([`request_region`], recorded as [`Workflow::region`]), and every
//! lookup, listing, name-uniqueness check and idempotency token is scoped to the
//! region of the calling request, because a regional AWS endpoint serves only the
//! resources created through it.

//! Every collection here is BOUNDED, because all three grow from caller requests:
//! `workflows` is capped at [`MAX_WORKFLOWS`], a workflow's `runs` at
//! [`MAX_RUNS_PER_WORKFLOW`] and its `versions` at [`MAX_VERSIONS_PER_WORKFLOW`] (a
//! create, a run start or an update past the ceiling is refused with the modelled
//! `ServiceQuotaExceededException`, and a workflow already holding that many runs
//! records no further automated one
//! ([`ComAmazonawsMwaaserverlessAmazonmwaaserverlessState::fire_due_scheduled_runs`]),
//! so the workflows x runs and workflows x versions
//! products are finite and so is the caller-supplied data each record holds); `workflow_names` holds exactly one
//! key per stored workflow, released when the delete's teardown removes the record
//! ([`ComAmazonawsMwaaserverlessAmazonmwaaserverlessState::reap_deleted_workflows`]);
//! a workflow's `tags` at [`MAX_TAGS_PER_RESOURCE`] (a tagging call past that ceiling is
//! refused and stores nothing); and the
//! idempotency ledger is capped and evicted on its own terms (see [`IdempotencyLedger`]).
//! A listing's response is bounded too, by the modelled `MaxResults` range.
//! A run's `task_instances` ([`TaskInstance`]) is NOT caller-driven growth: a task
//! instance exists because the run's definition DECLARED that task, so the map holds at
//! most one entry per declared task, which
//! [`workflow_definition::MAX_DECLARED_TASKS`] caps, and a run's plan
//! ([`workflow_execution::ExecutionPlan`]) holds one entry per task for the same reason.
//! The definition content a version freezes ([`WorkflowSnapshot::workflow_definition`])
//! is caller-driven data held per version, and is capped at
//! [`workflow_definition::MAX_DEFINITION_BYTES`] before a byte of the object is
//! buffered, so the versions x content product is finite too.
//! A run's `pending_log_lines` — the output it owes the log group its workflow configured
//! ([`run_logs`]) — is not caller-driven growth either: a line exists because a transition
//! of that run was materialised, so the queue holds at most the lines one execution
//! produces, which [`run_logs::MAX_PENDING_LOG_LINES`] caps, and the call that produced
//! them empties it.

// Request validation: the modelled `ValidationException` for a bad member value
// ===========================================================================
//
// Every operation of this service models `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) with
// `Message` and `Reason` @required and an optional `FieldList`
// (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="ValidationException,ValidationExceptionField")`).
// A member value that fails a constraint the model declares for it is therefore
// answered with that shape — a top-level `Message`, `Reason` =
// `fieldValidationFailed`, and one `FieldList` entry per offending member — and
// NOT with the framework's generic refusal envelope, which carries none of them.
//
// NOTHING about constraint checking is re-implemented here. The constraints a
// member's `skip_validation` strips off its generated member schema are
// RE-DECLARED below in the framework's own representation — a
// [`TraitMap`](::aws_smithy_schema::TraitMap) of
// [`LengthTrait`]/[`PatternTrait`]/[`EnumTrait`]/[`ElementConstraintsTrait`], the
// exact form `vendor/smithy-macros` would have attached — hung on a member schema
// of the same name, and the check itself is
// [`::aws_smithy_schema_server::constraints::validate`], the SAME walk the request
// boundary runs. So the clause, the elision of a long value, the violation cap and
// the lowerCamel path are all the framework's, and a request refused here reads
// identically to one refused at the boundary.
//
// An operation declares `skip_validation = [...]` on its input struct in
// `src/ops/types/` and hands the matching member schemas from this module to
// [`validate_members`]; its violations become the modelled error through
// [`constraint_validation_exception`].
//
// The ARN-typed members are the one class whose REPORTING is this service's own
// rather than the framework's: a request's ARNs are parsed by the service's own
// ARN validators, which state their own field name and message. The acceptance
// test is still the modelled `@pattern`, run by the same walk; only the refusal
// is worded by this service. See [`arn_validation_exception`].
//
// ONE member is deliberately NOT covered: the paginated operations' `MaxResults`
// and its `@range(1..100)`. The recorded AWS answer for an out-of-range page size
// is the request-validation layer's own envelope — a 400 whose body carries a
// lowercase `message` and neither `Reason` nor `FieldList` — so that bound is
// left where the framework boundary already refuses it, exactly as recorded.

/// The `ValidationExceptionReason` a bad member value carries.
