//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-personalizeruntime-amazonpersonalizeruntime service:
//! the **inference registry** every operation of this service reads.
//!
//! # The registry is the whole service
//!
//! Amazon Personalize Runtime models exactly three operations —
//! `GetRecommendations`, `GetPersonalizedRanking` and `GetActionRecommendations` —
//! and every one of them is a READ against a control-plane resource owned by the
//! sibling Amazon Personalize service: a campaign, a recommender, or a filter. None
//! of the three creates, updates or deletes anything, so no handler in this crate
//! writes to the registry; the one value a call mints is its own `recommendationId`
//! (see [`ComAmazonawsPersonalizeruntimeAmazonpersonalizeruntimeState::issue_recommendation_id`]).
//!
//! Resolving one of those ARNs has TWO refusals, not one, and they are told apart by
//! what the ARN itself claims:
//!
//! * An ARN whose own resource part names another resource type than the member it
//!   arrived in ([`ResourceKind`]) is no reference to such a resource at all, so
//!   nothing is looked up: `InvalidInputException` (HTTP 400) with the message
//!   `The given <kind> ARN is invalid: <arn>` (see [`Denied::invalid_arn`]).
//! * An ARN of the RIGHT resource type this registry does not hold is
//!   `InvalidInputException` (HTTP 400) with the message `<arn> does not exist or is
//!   not active yet.` for all three operations — the inference data plane cannot tell a
//!   resource that was never created from one that was created but has not reached
//!   ACTIVE, so it refuses both through the INVALID-INPUT channel (see
//!   [`Denied::unresolvable`]). A missing
//!   [`campaigns`](ComAmazonawsPersonalizeruntimeAmazonpersonalizeruntimeState::campaigns) /
//!   [`recommenders`](ComAmazonawsPersonalizeruntimeAmazonpersonalizeruntimeState::recommenders) /
//!   [`filters`](ComAmazonawsPersonalizeruntimeAmazonpersonalizeruntimeState::filters)
//!   entry is the single source of truth for that refusal.
//!
//! Both carry the same code and status, so the message is the only observable that
//! separates a reference the caller mixed up from one whose resource is still being
//! created — and only the second is a condition that can change by itself.
//!
//! # The registration seam, and the rule it follows
//!
//! A campaign, a recommender and a filter come into being through the Amazon
//! Personalize CONTROL PLANE (`CreateCampaign`, `CreateRecommender`, `CreateFilter`)
//! — operations this runtime service does not serve. So this emulator registers them
//! through three seams, [`register_campaign`], [`register_recommender`] and
//! [`register_filter`], which an emulator-internal caller calls on the shared engine:
//! the sibling control-plane crate's own `CreateCampaign` and `CreateFilter` handlers
//! do exactly that, so a client provisioning a pipeline over the wire is what makes a
//! campaign exist here.
//!
//! The rule, stated once so no handler has to re-decide it:
//!
//! * A campaign, recommender or filter exists **only** after its seam registered it,
//!   and a campaign is served only once the clock has completed its create
//!   ([`Campaign::active_at`]). There is deliberately NO auto-registration on first
//!   reference: auto-registration
//!   would make `GetRecommendations` answer 200 for a campaign that was never
//!   created, which is the one answer the real service never gives.
//! * The item and action catalogs are stored with the campaign or recommender that
//!   serves them, because that is what the resolved resource's solution version was
//!   trained on. Every item id, action id, score and metadata value a response
//!   carries is read from those stored catalogs.
//! * A filter's expression is validated when the filter is REGISTERED, exactly as
//!   `CreateFilter` validates it, so a stored filter is always one the runtime can
//!   apply. What a REQUEST binds its placeholders to is a fact about the request, so a
//!   value a clause cannot apply is reported where the request is served.
