//! The request id a response reports, for every emulated service: the `<RequestId>`
//! element an `awsQuery` `<ErrorResponse>` carries beside its `<Error>`, and the response
//! HEADER AWS reports the same id in whatever the protocol.
//!
//! AWS answers an `awsQuery` error with
//!
//! ```xml
//! <ErrorResponse>
//!   <Error><Type>Sender</Type><Code>…</Code><Message>…</Message></Error>
//!   <RequestId>…</RequestId>
//! </ErrorResponse>
//! ```
//!
//! The `<RequestId>` belongs to the ENVELOPE, not to any modelled error shape: no model
//! declares it, and it is what an SDK exposes as the failed call's request id
//! (`ResponseMetadata.RequestId` in botocore), the counterpart of the
//! `ResponseMetadata/RequestId` the framework's SUCCESS renderer already writes. The
//! framework's error renderers write `<Error>` alone
//! (`aws_smithy_schema_server::query_error_body` and the `awsQuery` `serialize_error`), so
//! a service that wants the whole envelope adds the element here — through the two seams
//! below, which cover every layer that can answer an error:
//!
//! * [`RequestIdEnvelopeOperation`], the operation wrapper a service hands back from
//!   `Service::override_operation`, covers a handler-returned modelled error and a
//!   framework refusal raised while a matched operation was being served (an absent
//!   required member, a value outside a declared bound) — with
//!   [`RequestIdHeaderOperation`] and [`RequestIdErrorMemberOperation`] as the same
//!   wrapper under the other two reports, or [`RequestIdReportingOperation`], for a
//!   service that holds its operations already wrapped and composes the report around
//!   them;
//! * [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition`], the definition wrapper a service hands back from
//!   `Service::definition`, covers a routing failure (an `Action` naming no modelled
//!   operation), a transport failure detected before any operation was named, and a
//!   pre-dispatch authentication refusal;
//! * a response a service renders ITSELF (an API-version refusal on a shared endpoint,
//!   say) is passed through [`with_request_id`] directly.
//!
//! # The two reports
//!
//! WHERE a response states the id is the one protocol-dependent part, so it is the one
//! thing a service chooses here. The two seams above take that choice as a REPORT — a
//! function from the rendered response to the response as it is sent — and the plumbing
//! around it (resolving the modelled operation, delegating to it, wrapping the three
//! framework-level renderers) is stated once and shared by both:
//!
//! * [`with_request_id`], the `awsQuery` report: the `<RequestId>` element in the error
//!   envelope AND the header, carrying one id so a client correlating on either sees the
//!   same value. Reached through [`RequestIdEnvelopeOperation`] and
//!   [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition::new`].
//! * [`with_request_id_header`], the protocol-independent report: the header ALONE, on
//!   every response — success or failure — which is what a service whose protocol has no
//!   envelope element for the id (`restJson1`, `restXml`, `awsJson`, `rpcv2Cbor`) answers
//!   with. Reached through [`RequestIdHeaderOperation`] and
//!   [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition::header_only`].
//! * [`with_request_id_error_member`], the JSON-error-body report: the `requestId` MEMBER
//!   beside the `__type` and the `message`, which is what a service whose recorded failures
//!   carry the id in the body itself answers with. Reached through
//!   [`RequestIdErrorMemberOperation`] (a service serving its generated routing table
//!   unchanged), [`RequestIdReportingOperation::error_member`] (one serving its operations
//!   already wrapped) and [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition::error_member`].
//!
//! WHERE the id is stated is the protocol's; WHAT it is spelled like is the service's. The
//! three writers above mint [`new_request_id`], the form almost every AWS service reports,
//! and a service whose own ids are spelled another way mints them itself, states them with
//! [`with_stated_request_id_header`], and hands THAT report ([`Report`]) to
//! [`RequestIdEnvelopeDefinition::reporting`] — so the choice of form costs a service its
//! minting function and nothing else.
//!
//! Only the request id is this module's business: the HTTP status, the `<Type>`, the
//! `<Code>`, the `<Message>`, the body of a success and every other header stay with the
//! framework renderer that owns them, so each has exactly one home. The only
//! protocol-specific part is the `awsQuery` element: a document that is not an `awsQuery`
//! `<ErrorResponse>` is returned untouched by [`with_request_id`], so a service of any
//! other protocol can hold that wrapper harmlessly — and reaches for
//! [`with_request_id_header`] instead, which reports the id on its every response without
//! reading the body at all.
//!
//! This is the shared home the service-local copies of this rule record as their migration
//! target — `services/service-com-amazonaws-rds-amazonrdsv19`,
//! `services/service-com-amazonaws-docdb-amazonrdsv19`,
//! `services/service-com-amazonaws-cloudformation-cloudformation`,
//! `services/service-com-amazonaws-sns-amazonsimplenotificationservice`,
//! `services/service-com-amazonaws-autoscaling-autoscaling-2011-01-01`,
//! `services/service-com-amazonaws-elasticbeanstalk-awselasticbeanstalkservice` and
//! `services/service-com-amazonaws-redshift-redshiftserviceversion20121201`, each in that
//! service's own `src/service/query_error_envelope.rs`. This module carries the most
//! complete of those behaviours — the `x-amzn-requestid` header and the sibling-scoped
//! idempotence check that the latest of them (autoscaling, redshift) have, which the
//! earlier ones (rds, docdb, cloudformation, sns) do not — so a service migrating onto it
//! gains those two and loses nothing; performing those migrations belongs to those
//! services' issues, so they are left where they are rather than moved by a change that
//! does not own them. Nothing NEW should state the rule again — call this module.
