//! HOW the CloudWatch Logs grant reaches a function's execution role, and what a synchronous
//! invocation then leaves in the function's log group.
//!
//! RULE: a successful synchronous `Invoke` of a function whose execution role's POLICY SET
//! allows `logs:CreateLogGroup`, `logs:CreateLogStream` and `logs:PutLogEvents` creates the
//! function's log group if it is absent — the one its `LoggingConfig$LogGroup` names, else the
//! default `/aws/lambda/<function name>` — opens a stream of that invocation in it, and writes
//! that run's log into it as one event per line, the `START RequestId: <id> Version: <version>`
//! frame, every line the handler wrote, the `END RequestId: <id>` frame and the
//! `REPORT RequestId: <id>` line that states what the run spent; the events are readable by the
//! time the call is answered. The decision is made on the policy SET in force on the role, so it
//! does not depend on which document carries the grant: an inline policy, the AWS-managed
//! `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` attached to the role, or a customer-managed policy attached to
//! it each carry it, and a role whose only attached document grants nothing on CloudWatch Logs
//! carries it from nowhere, which leaves the group uncreated and the invocation answered all
//! the same.
//!
//! What the neighbouring suites already pin, and this one does not repeat:
//! [`crate::invocation_log_delivery`] walks what is written and which of the three writes an
//! INLINE policy allows, and [`crate::invocation_log_group_search`] walks the group-wide search
//! that finds it. What only this suite states is that the CARRIER of the grant is not part of
//! the rule — the case a client creating a role the way AWS's own console and every quickstart
//! does (`CreateRole`, then `AttachRolePolicy` with the managed basic-execution policy) depends
//! on — and that a synchronous invocation's events are in the group when its call returns,
//! without a poll.
//!
//! Every row drives real HTTP through the production `MultiServiceRouter` with Lambda,
//! CloudWatch Logs and IAM mounted on ONE engine, reusing that suite's harness so the two
//! cannot drift about what a delivery is. The rows differ along what the rule generalises over:
//! which document carries the grant (an attached AWS-managed policy, that policy beside an
//! inline policy about another service, an attached customer-managed policy, and an attached
//! AWS-managed policy carrying no logs grant at all), which RUNTIME ran (python and node), how
//! many lines the handler wrote (one, three), and which group the log goes to (the default, and
//! one the function's `LoggingConfig` names).
//!
//! Every test here RUNS handlers, so each takes the target's one invocation stream
//! ([`crate::invoke_request_id::one_invocation_stream_at_a_time`]).
