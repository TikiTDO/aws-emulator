//! The Parameter Store calls a RUNNING handler makes with the AWS SDK its runtime supplies,
//! end to end over the wire: Lambda and AWS Systems Manager on ONE engine, a `python3.x`
//! function whose code does `import boto3` and calls Parameter Store, and every parameter it
//! wrote read back where a client reads it — through that service's own `GetParameter`.
//!
//! The rule pinned here: a managed runtime ships the AWS SDK for the handler's language on its
//! import path, so a handler can call a service of this emulator with no dependency of its own,
//! and what the call answers is THAT service's own answer — a success carrying the operation's
//! output members and leaving the state that service then reports, or that service's modelled
//! refusal raised as `botocore.exceptions.ClientError` carrying its error code. A parameter a
//! handler writes is therefore the parameter Parameter Store holds, which is how the work one
//! invocation performed is observed from outside it.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: WHICH operation of the service is
//! called (a create, a create of another parameter TYPE, an overwrite, a read), whether the
//! call succeeds or is refused, and which modelled refusal it earns (a create of a name the
//! store already holds, a read of a name it does not hold). Each row asserts both halves — what
//! the handler read back, which is what it returns as the invocation's payload, and what
//! Parameter Store itself holds afterwards — so a call that answered without doing the work, or
//! did the work without answering, fails here.
//!
//! The suite RUNS a handler, so it takes the target's one invocation stream
//! ([`crate::invoke_request_id::one_invocation_stream_at_a_time`]).
