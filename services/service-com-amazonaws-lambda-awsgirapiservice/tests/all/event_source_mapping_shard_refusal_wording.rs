//! How Lambda WORDS the refusal of a wiring call whose function's execution role may not
//! read the SHARD event source it names.
//!
//! RULE: when a mapping onto a shard event source is refused because the invoked function's
//! execution role is short one of the reads Lambda's poller makes on that source, the
//! modelled `InvalidParameterValueException` (HTTP 400) carries the sentence the SOURCE
//! SERVICE's own error class is worded with — `Cannot access stream <the EventSourceArn the
//! request named>. Please ensure the role can perform the <that source's read actions, comma
//! separated with `and` before the last> Actions on your stream` closed by the tail that
//! source's wording ends on, which is ` in IAM.` for an Amazon DynamoDB stream and `.` for
//! an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Only the ARN varies with the request; everything else is
//! fixed text of the source's own wording, so the tail is not shared between the two
//! sources.
//!
//! The first test is a table over what the rule generalises over: WHICH shard source is
//! named, WHICH ARN of that source (two different DynamoDB streams, of two tables and two
//! stream labels), and WHY the role falls short (nothing about the source granted at all,
//! the other shard service's reads granted instead, the reads granted on another stream of
//! the same service, one of the polled reads missing, every read granted with one explicitly
//! denied) — beside the served controls that prove the refusal is not unconditional, each
//! read back through `GetEventSourceMapping`.
//!
//! The second test drives the same rule on a stream this emulator MINTED: a table created
//! with `StreamSpecification` through DynamoDB's own API, mounted beside Lambda and IAM on
//! one engine, so the ARN in the sentence is the `LatestStreamArn` that table reports rather
//! than a constant written here — and the same pair is accepted once the role carries the
//! four reads on it.
