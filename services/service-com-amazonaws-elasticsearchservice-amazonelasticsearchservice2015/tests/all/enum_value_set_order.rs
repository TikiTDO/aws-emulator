//! End-to-end tests for the ORDER an enumerated member's refusal lists the admitted
//! values in, on this API's 2015-01-01 surface.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the router
//! into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client sees. The harness is
//! [`crate::harness`], this crate's one copy.
//!
//! RULE: a value outside an enumerated member's set is refused with the standard
//! constraint report over that member's WHOLE admitted set, and the ORDER the set is
//! listed in is the order this front door walks its own hash table over those values —
//! neither the order the model declares them in nor lexicographic. The order belongs to
//! the enumerated TYPE and is computed from the values themselves, so it is the same
//! whatever value was rejected, whichever member carried it and whichever operation it
//! arrived at; it is also the order a HANDLER-stated clause of this surface already lists
//! a set in (`src/state/request_constraints.rs`, for a map's keys).
//!
//! The table varies what the rule generalises over: the binding the value arrives on (a
//! query parameter, a body member nested in a structure), the operation, the size of the
//! set (two values, four, and the model's largest enumerated type) and the shape of the
//! rejected value.
