//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-resourceexplorer2-resourceexplorer service.
//!
//! Everything the implemented operations answer with is derived from the values
//! stored here: one index per Region, the views created in each Region, the
//! Region's default view, and the resource inventory the Region's index holds.
//!
//! This module also carries the few rules more than one operation needs, because
//! an operation file is the only file for that operation and may not be reached
//! from a sibling:
//!
//! * [`ComAmazonawsResourceexplorer2ResourceexplorerState::settle`] — the
//!   clock-owed index lifecycle transitions (`CREATING` -> `ACTIVE`, `UPDATING` ->
//!   `ACTIVE`, `DELETING` -> `DELETED`, taking the Region's views with it), and the
//!   setup-task steps that wait on them.
//! * [`ComAmazonawsResourceexplorer2ResourceexplorerState::insert_index`] /
//!   [`ComAmazonawsResourceexplorer2ResourceexplorerState::insert_view`] — the ONE
//!   place an index or a view is created, so the operations that create one cannot
//!   disagree about its ARN or its stored shape.
//! * [`ComAmazonawsResourceexplorer2ResourceexplorerState::index_for_new_view`] — the
//!   index a new view is queried through, and the account-level setup a Region nothing
//!   has acted on is served as already having.
//! * [`IndexEntry::to_wire`] / [`ViewEntry::to_wire`] — the modelled `Index` and
//!   `View` structures, so `CreateView` and `GetView` cannot disagree about what a
//!   stored view looks like.
//! * [`SetupTask`] — the multi-Region setup tasks
//!   `CreateResourceExplorerSetup` starts and `GetResourceExplorerSetup` reports on.
//! * [`paginate`] / [`encode_page_token`] — the opaque `NextToken` cursors the
//!   `@paginated` operations share. The offset travels INSIDE the token, so a
//!   `@readonly` list operation never writes cursor state.
//! * [`query_matches`] — the Resource Explorer search query syntax, used by
//!   `Search` and `ListResources` for both the caller's own query and the view's
//!   `Filters.FilterString`, with [`is_filter_name`] / [`free_form_term`] telling a
//!   filter prefix from free-form text.
//! * [`ComAmazonawsResourceexplorer2ResourceexplorerState::query_view`] — the view a
//!   query must use, and the single refusal both ways of failing to resolve one carry.
//! * [`IndexedResource::to_wire`] — the modelled `Resource` structure, so the two query
//!   operations cannot disagree about how an indexed resource is reported.
//! * [`owners`] — the owning services whose resources a Region's index holds, read from
//!   those services' own records at query time.
