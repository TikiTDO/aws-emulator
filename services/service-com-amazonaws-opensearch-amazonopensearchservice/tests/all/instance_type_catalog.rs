//! End-to-end tests for `ListInstanceTypeDetails`.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a
//! client sees, not what a handler returns. The harness comes from
//! [`super::domain_lifecycle`]; this suite adds no second copy of it.
//!
//! The tests assert RULES over sets of inputs, not one recorded call, and they assert
//! them about the ANSWER rather than against a second copy of the service's table:
//!
//! * the listing is the catalog the service publishes for the named release, published
//!   family by family in the documented order — the current generations by family name,
//!   then the warm tier, then the previous generations, each family's types smallest
//!   size first — which is neither the modelled `OpenSearchPartitionInstanceType` value
//!   set nor its order: the catalog carries current-generation families that enum does
//!   not list at all, carries every value it does list, and leaves out a family the
//!   release does not offer;
//! * each entry's `InstanceRole` is the set of node roles an instance of its FAMILY
//!   serves — the same for every size of a family and on every release that offers it,
//!   never a coordinator without a master, never the warm role beside another — and
//!   each feature member follows the engine release the feature is available from AND
//!   what the family can serve; a feature available on one release stays available on a
//!   later one;
//! * the `instanceType` filter reports exactly the entry it names, over a table of
//!   types drawn from the listing, answers an empty listing for a published type the
//!   release does not offer, and refuses a value that names no published instance type;
//! * the release's catalog is reported COMPLETE in a single answer, with no `NextToken`
//!   member at all, over a table of page sizes: `MaxResults` does not bound what is
//!   reported and no token is ever handed out, while a `MaxResults` outside the modelled
//!   range is still refused at either end; a token names a place in the listing, so an
//!   answer resumed from one is the listing's suffix and a token naming no entry of the
//!   listing is refused;
//! * `retrieveAZs` is what puts Availability Zones in the answer, and the zones are
//!   those of the Region the listing is for — the signing Region, or the Region of the
//!   domain the request names;
//! * a `domainName` that names no domain, and an `EngineVersion` that names no engine
//!   release, are refused with the modelled errors;
//! * the read changes nothing a later caller sees.
