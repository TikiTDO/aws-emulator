//! End-to-end tests for what the package-association calls answer a `DomainName` the
//! account holds no domain under — and, in particular, that each of them answers it
//! with ITS OWN sentence.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a
//! client sees, not what a handler returns. This suite adds no second copy of anything
//! the package suites already have: the harness comes from [`super::domain_lifecycle`],
//! the package helpers from [`super::package_associations`], the dissociate request
//! helpers from [`super::package_dissociation`], the associate and listing helpers from
//! [`super::package_listing_page_bounds`], and the table of names no domain is held
//! under from [`super::package_listing_for_missing_domain`].
//!
//! The rules asserted here are:
//!
//! * a refusal's WORDING belongs to the operation that answers, not to the decision
//!   the operations share: for a `DomainName` that resolves to no domain, the call that
//!   unlinks a single package is refused with the service's fixed sentence about a
//!   domain that is not on the latest software version, while the calls that link a
//!   package are refused with the sentence naming the domain that does not exist —
//!   over the table of such names and over a table of `PackageID`s the pattern admits,
//!   including one of a package the account holds;
//! * that sentence is bound to the name that could not be resolved, not to the
//!   operation: on a domain that EXISTS, the same call keeps the service's own sentence
//!   for a package that resolves to nothing and for a link the domain is not holding,
//!   and serves the link it is holding;
//! * every one of these refusals leaves the domain's links exactly as they were.
