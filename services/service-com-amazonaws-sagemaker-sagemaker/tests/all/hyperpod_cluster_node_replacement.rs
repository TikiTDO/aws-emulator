//! End-to-end wire tests for SageMaker HyperPod's `BatchReplaceClusterNodes`: the nodes a
//! request names are replaced in place, with `DescribeClusterNode` and `ListClusterNodes`
//! as the readers each replacement is checked against.
//!
//! Every case goes over the wire (`POST /` with `X-Amz-Target: SageMaker.<Op>`,
//! `awsJson1_1`) through the same `MultiServiceRouter` the production router uses, so what
//! these tests exercise is what a real SDK client gets. The harness is the one
//! `inference_deployment_lifecycle` declares.
//!
//! The tests assert RULES over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded call:
//!
//! * every identifier a call accepts is answered in the position the request listed it,
//!   whichever order that is and whichever identifier kind named it;
//! * a replaced node keeps its `NodeLogicalId` and its configuration while its instance is
//!   terminated, and comes back on a freshly minted instance id;
//! * replacing a node destroys the volumes it held;
//! * an identifier the cluster does not hold, and one whose node is mid-change, is
//!   reported in the matching failure list with the modelled per-node error code, leaving
//!   the identifiers beside it in the same batch replaced;
//! * a request naming no node at all, or more nodes than one call may replace, is refused,
//!   and so is one naming a cluster this account does not hold.
