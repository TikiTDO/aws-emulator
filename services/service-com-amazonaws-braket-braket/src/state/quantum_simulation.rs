//! The simulator a quantum task's gate-model program is RUN on.
//!
//! A managed simulator device answers a shot-based run with one measurement per shot, so
//! that is what this module produces: the program's circuit is built and evolved by the
//! `qip` state-vector simulator, the crate computes the probability of each outcome of
//! the measured qubits from the final state, and each shot is one draw from that
//! distribution. Nothing is synthesised from the program text: a gate this module cannot
//! build a matrix for stops the run with the reason, and the task that carries it ends in
//! the modelled failure status rather than reporting measurements nothing produced.
//!
//! The run is bounded by the program's own ceilings
//! ([`super::quantum_program::MAX_PROGRAM_QUBITS`] and
//! [`super::quantum_program::MAX_PROGRAM_GATES`]) and by the device's published shot
//! range, which `CreateQuantumTask` holds the request to before anything runs. The work
//! is therefore bounded by a published figure in every direction: the state vector, the
//! gates applied to it, and the draws taken from it.
