//! End-to-end tests for the Glue ETL registration slice: `CreateJob` / `GetJob` and
//! `CreateConnection` / `GetConnection`.
//!
//! Every call goes over the wire the way a client makes it — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: AWSGlue.<Operation>` and an `awsJson1_1` body — through the same
//! `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` the production front door uses, on the shared harness
//! [`super::wire`] owns.
//!
//! The rules under test, each with its source in the model's own documentation:
//!
//! * `CreateJob` creates a job DEFINITION and answers its name; `GetJob` reports that
//!   stored definition back, with the members the request supplied plus the defaults the
//!   model documents for the ones it omitted — `JobMode` ("When the JobMode field is
//!   missing or null, SCRIPT is assigned as the default value"), `GlueVersion` (the version
//!   the service fills in for a create that named none, which every read reports),
//!   `Timeout` ("the
//!   timeout is defaulted to 2,880 minutes for Glue version 4.0 and earlier, or 480
//!   minutes for Glue version 5.0 and later") and
//!   `ExecutionProperty$MaxConcurrentRuns` ("The default is 1").
//! * A job name is unique per account ("It must be unique in your account") and is the
//!   create's idempotency identifier, so a repeat carrying ANOTHER definition is
//!   `IdempotentParameterMismatchException`; a request contradicting a documented rule is
//!   `InvalidInputException` and writes nothing.
//! * `CreateConnection` creates a connection definition in the addressed catalog, which
//!   `GetConnection` reports back; `HidePassword` withholds the password properties from
//!   every property map the answer carries ("Allows you to retrieve the connection
//!   metadata without returning the password"),
//!   `ApplyOverrideForComputeEnvironment` overlays that environment's property map
//!   ("specifies returning properties for the specified compute environment"), and
//!   `ConnectionSchemaVersion` is 2 for a connection carrying those per-environment maps
//!   ("Version 2 supports properties for specific compute environments") and 1 otherwise.
//!
//! The suites are TABLES: each row is one input along the axis the rule generalises over
//! (the job command, the Glue version, which optional members the request carries, the
//! connection type, which property maps it sets, which compute environment is asked for),
//! and the recorded `glueetl`/`s3://…` case from the issue is one row among them.
