//! The Data Catalog's EXPORT configuration: the record a
//! `PutDataCatalogExportConfiguration` writes for one catalog and
//! `GetDataCatalogExportConfiguration` reports, with the status the clock owes it while a
//! change it asked for is still being applied.
//!
//! ONE record per catalog, exactly as the catalog's security configuration is
//! ([`Catalog::encryption_settings`]): neither operation that addresses the export
//! configuration carries a `CatalogId`, so the account's own Data Catalog
//! ([`resolve_catalog_id`]) is the whole address and a write REPLACES the record rather
//! than adding to it.
//!
//! The SETTING is what a write asked for and the STATUS is how far the service has got with
//! it: "Specify ENABLED to start exporting catalog metadata to S3 Tables, or DISABLED to
//! stop exporting" against a status of "ENABLING, ENABLED, DISABLING, DISABLED, and FAILED".
//! So a write that changes the setting leaves the catalog in the transitional status of that
//! direction, and the clock owes it the settled one ([`EXPORT_CONFIGURATION_SETTLES_AFTER`]);
//! the status is DERIVED from the stored due instant whenever the record is read, so nothing
//! sleeps and no read has to write.
