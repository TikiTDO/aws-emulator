//! @op CreateComplianceInquiry
//! Creates a compliance inquiry: mints its `InquiryId`, enumerates the queries its
//! content carries, and persists the record in [`crate::state`], so every later read of
//! it — `GetComplianceInquiryMetadata` here, `ListComplianceInquiries` and the tag
//! operations once they are implemented — answers from the one stored resource.
//!
//! Four rules shape the handler:
//!
//! * The inquiry is created NON-TERMINAL. AWS answers this operation with HTTP 202 and
//!   an inquiry whose `status` is `PROCESSING`, so the terminal status is owed by the
//!   CLOCK, not by any later call: the due instant is stored
//!   (`crate::state::INQUIRY_PROCESSING_SPAN`) and
//!   [`crate::state::ComplianceInquiry::materialise`] applies the transition when a
//!   reader arrives after it. Nothing sleeps, and a caller polling straight after the
//!   create still observes `PROCESSING`.
//! * `clientToken` is this operation's `@idempotencyToken`: a repeat carrying the same
//!   token answers with the inquiry the first call created rather than creating a second,
//!   and the same token on DIFFERENT content is refused with the modelled
//!   `ConflictException` — an idempotency token identifies one call, so honouring it on
//!   other content would hide the second submission.
//! * The name every READ of the inquiry reports is DERIVED FROM ITS CONTENT when the
//!   content derives one: a submission made of a single text query is reported under that
//!   query text, which is the only content-derived handle `InquirySummary` exposes, so a
//!   caller that submitted a query finds its inquiry in `ListComplianceInquiries` under
//!   exactly what it sent. The caller-supplied title is kept verbatim on the record and
//!   stands as the reported name only for content that derives none (an uploaded
//!   document, whose queries are written inside the file). The one projection
//!   ([`crate::state::ComplianceInquiry::display_name`]) serves this create, the listing,
//!   `GetComplianceInquiryMetadata` and the exported document.
//! * The queries an inquiry owns are the UNITS OF WORK its submitted content carries, one
//!   each: the query a text submission carries, and one per section of an uploaded
//!   document — "[l]ist of file sections/sheets to process"
//!   (`InquiryFileContent$fileSections`) — with the document as a whole when the request
//!   names no section. The one enumeration
//!   ([`crate::state::InquiryContentRecord::work_units`]) serves every content form, so
//!   `ListComplianceInquiryQueries` reports what was submitted for processing whatever
//!   form it took, and `supportMode` selects the review each of them carries
//!   ([`crate::state::review_type_for`]).
//! * A request member the model restricts to one FORM of the submitted content is refused
//!   when the content takes another: `supportMode` is "[o]nly supported for file upload
//!   mode", so the mode that adds human expert review cannot be asked for of a submission
//!   that is not an upload, and such a request is answered with the modelled 400
//!   `ValidationException` naming the member
//!   ([`crate::state::support_mode_available_for`]). The inquiry therefore only ever
//!   stores — and every read only ever reports — a support mode its queries really were
//!   reviewed under.
//! * A tag the request carries is written onto the inquiry it creates, under the same rule
//!   the tag write enforces: a key in the reserved `aws:` namespace
//!   ([`crate::state::RESERVED_TAG_KEY_PREFIX`]) is Amazon Web Services' own, so such a
//!   request is refused with the modelled 400 `ValidationException` naming `tags` and no
//!   inquiry is created.
//! * The inquiry's RESPONSES are RETRIEVED from the published report catalog this service
//!   serves: the documents whose text carries the submitted query's terms are the sources,
//!   and the response a query reports is the passages of those documents, each under the
//!   source it was read out of, with a citation naming where that document is published
//!   ([`crate::state::answer_from_catalog`]). Nothing is synthesised to look generated — a
//!   query the catalog holds nothing bearing on carries no `response` and no citation, a
//!   query is reported under the handle its submission gave it, never under question text
//!   nothing read, and no query is failed for work nothing ran.
//! * Only a submission carrying NOTHING to process ends in the modelled failure state
//!   ([`crate::state::InquiryContentRecord::nothing_to_process`], read by `materialise`).
//!   A unit of work whose handle this API's own `query` member cannot carry is reported as
//!   no query, which is a limit of what can be REPORTED and not a processing failure, so
//!   it leaves the inquiry's terminal status alone.
//!
//! The create persists a resource, so it is ATTRIBUTABLE on the same terms as this crate's
//! other state changes: this handler leaves exactly one structured record naming the caller
//! (the access-key id and the credential-scope region the request presented), what the call
//! addressed and the outcome — on the refusal and replay paths as much as on the success one,
//! since a state-changing call that changed nothing is still attributable. Never the
//! inquiry's name or content, both `@sensitive` in the model.
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `CreateComplianceInquiry::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `CreateComplianceInquiry`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-artifact-artifact/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-artifact-artifact.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Create a new compliance inquiry.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `clientToken` (IdempotentClientToken, len 1..128, pattern ^[\w\-]+$, @idempotencyToken)
//!   — Idempotency token for the request.
//! * `inquiryContent` (InquiryContent) **required** — Content for creating a compliance
//!   inquiry - either a single query or file content.
//! * `name` (InquiryName) **required** — Title of the inquiry.
//! * `supportMode` (InquirySupportMode, one of: AI_ONLY | FULL_SUPPORT) — Support mode for
//!   inquiry processing. Only supported for file upload mode. Defaults to AI_ONLY if not
//!   specified.
//! * `tags` (TagsMap, len ..50) — Tags to associate with the compliance inquiry resource.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `complianceInquirySummary` (InquirySummary) — Summary information about the created
//!   compliance inquiry.
//! * `tags` (TagsMap, len ..50) — Tags associated with the compliance inquiry resource.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `AccessDeniedException` (HTTP 403) — User does not have sufficient access to perform
//!   this action.
//! * `ConflictException` (HTTP 409) — Request to create/modify content would result in a
//!   conflict.
//! * `InternalServerException` (HTTP 500) — An unknown server exception has occurred.
//! * `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 429) — Request was denied due to request throttling.
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — Request fails to satisfy the constraints specified by
//!   an AWS service.
