//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-artifact-artifact service.
//!
//! AWS Artifact's report catalog is SERVICE-owned: the API has no `CreateReport`, so
//! every report a caller can see was published by AWS itself. This module therefore
//! holds the catalog as the state struct's [`Default`], which `engine::InMemoryEngine`
//! builds the first time any handler reaches the store. Seeding in `Default` — rather
//! than from the first read — is what keeps every report operation a pure reporting
//! operation: no `ListReports`, `GetReportMetadata` or `ListReportVersions` call writes
//! anything, so a read can never change what a later caller sees.
//!
//! The one thing a caller does create is a TERM GRANT: `GetTermForReport` mints the
//! acceptance receipt (`termToken`) that `GetReport` requires, and that token is
//! persisted here so `GetReport` can check it against the TERM it was issued for. A
//! grant is bound to the term document the caller accepted, not to the report it was
//! requested through: every version of a report is governed by one term document, so a
//! token minted for any report version governed by that document covers the others too,
//! and a token minted under a different term document covers none of them.
//!
//! Every report and term DOCUMENT lives here as bytes beside the record it belongs to,
//! so the URL `GetReport` and `GetTermForReport` announce resolves to a document this
//! service actually holds: the data plane behind that URL ([`crate::service`]) reads the
//! same [`Document`] this module seeded, and the URL names the endpoint the caller
//! reached this emulator on ([`document_url_host`]) rather than a real AWS host.
//!
//! The other caller-owned record is the account's SETTINGS: `PutAccountSettings` writes
//! the one `AccountSettings` record this store holds and `GetAccountSettings` reports it
//! back, so a setting a caller writes is what every later read of it answers with.
//!
//! COMPLIANCE INQUIRIES are the one thing a caller CREATES through this API:
//! `CreateComplianceInquiry` mints one, so the records live in the state struct rather
//! than in its [`Default`]. An inquiry carries its own clock-owed transition — AWS
//! answers the create with HTTP 202 and a non-terminal `PROCESSING` status — which
//! [`ComplianceInquiry::materialise`] applies from the stored due instant, so a reader
//! only ever materialises a change the clock had already made due. That same transition
//! RELEASES each query's answer — the `response` the retrieval over the published report
//! catalog produced for it and the `citations` naming where those sources are published,
//! which live in [`inquiry_answers`].
//!
//! An inquiry also carries the one TAG SET this service persists: `TagResource`,
//! `UntagResource` and `ListTagsForResource` act on the tags of the resource their
//! `resourceArn` names, and the only resource an account owns here is an inquiry (see
//! [`ComAmazonawsArtifactArtifactState::tagged_resource`]), so the tags live on the
//! inquiry record that `CreateComplianceInquiry` already accepts them with rather than in
//! a second map beside it. A tag write is therefore a modification of the INQUIRY, so it
//! moves that record's last-modified instant exactly as the clock-owed transition does
//! ([`ComplianceInquiry::record_modification`]).
//!
//! FEEDBACK is the other record a caller writes onto an inquiry:
//! `PutComplianceInquiryFeedback` records a rating on one of the inquiry's queries (or on
//! the inquiry's response as a whole when the request names no query), so an
//! [`InquiryFeedback`] lives on the inquiry record beside its tags, keyed by the
//! [`FeedbackTarget`] it was given on — the query AND the response revision of it. One
//! target carries at most ONE feedback ever: a second submission against a target that
//! already carries feedback is refused with [`feedback_already_submitted`] rather than
//! replacing it, which is the guard `PutComplianceInquiryFeedbackRequest$responseRevisionId`
//! advertises ("use this value to prevent submitting feedback on a stale response"), and
//! the record is reported back in the document [`ComplianceInquiry::export_document`]
//! renders. That
//! document's `feedback` key is this EMULATOR's rendering of what it holds, not modelled
//! content: AWS publishes an export as an opaque S3 object whose format the API does not
//! state (see [`INQUIRY_EXPORT_OBJECT`]), and the key is what makes the stored feedback
//! readable at all — the model declares no operation that reports it back. The
//! `clientToken` that call carries is remembered in
//! [`ComAmazonawsArtifactArtifactState::inquiry_feedback_tokens`], and the model has the
//! service IGNORE a later request carrying a remembered one, answering it with that call's
//! instant — so a token never produces a refusal here: the per-target rule above is the
//! only thing that refuses a submission, and it is reached by every request whose token this
//! service has not already recorded.
//!
//! An inquiry EXPORT is the second thing a caller creates: `ExportComplianceInquiry`
//! produces a document from one inquiry, so each call mints an [`InquiryExport`] whose id
//! the presigned URL it answers with carries. That document is served the same way a
//! report's is — from the bytes the export stored, under the endpoint the caller reached
//! ([`document_url_host`]) and a path this service publishes
//! ([`EXPORT_DOCUMENT_PATH_PREFIX`]) — so the URL the export announces resolves for
//! whoever was handed it, and it is authorised the same way too: the export's own
//! [`InquiryExport::download_token`] travels in that URL and is what the data plane
//! requires of a fetch ([`ComAmazonawsArtifactArtifactState::export_download_authorised`]),
//! exactly as a term grant's token authorises a report download.
//!
//! The CUSTOMER-AGREEMENT set is held the same way as the catalog, and for the same
//! reason: the API has no operation that creates, accepts or terminates one — an
//! account's agreements are established outside this API — so the set a caller can see is
//! persisted state built by this struct's [`Default`], and `ListCustomerAgreements` only
//! reads it. Unlike a report, a customer-agreement belongs to the calling identity's
//! ACCOUNT, which is what its ARN and its `awsAccountId` name.
