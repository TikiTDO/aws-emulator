//! A compliance inquiry's QUERIES and the state they put it in, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! Every assertion goes through the router, so each case exercises routing,
//! deserialization, the handler, the persisted state and serialization — the same path a
//! client takes. The rule under test is one rule over every form of submitted content:
//!
//! * an inquiry owns ONE QUERY PER UNIT OF WORK its content submits — the query a text
//!   submission carries, and one per section of an uploaded document
//!   (`InquiryFileContent$fileSections`, "List of file sections/sheets to process"), with
//!   the document as a whole when the request names no section — so
//!   `ListComplianceInquiryQueries` reports them in ascending `queryIdentifier` and
//!   `PutComplianceInquiryFeedback` can name each one;
//! * `supportMode` selects the REVIEW each of those queries carries: `FULL_SUPPORT`
//!   "includes human expert review" and is "[o]nly supported for file upload mode", so an
//!   uploaded document submitted under it carries `ReviewType` `HUMAN` and rests in
//!   `InquiryStatus` `HUMAN_REVIEW` with "Human review is in progress." while that review
//!   is pending, and everything else is `AI`-reviewed and reaches `COMPLETED` with
//!   "Compliance inquiry processing is complete.";
//! * the modelled internal-error state is reserved for a submission that carried NOTHING
//!   to process (an upload with no bytes); a submission that carried content reaches a
//!   non-failure terminal status even when no unit of work of it could be reported inside
//!   the modelled bounds of `QuerySummary$query`.
//!
//! A query reports an answer only once its processing is over, and only when the published
//! report catalog holds a document bearing on the handle that unit of work was submitted
//! under: the `response` and the `citations` supporting it are always reported together, and
//! a unit of work the catalog has nothing on reports neither.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the form of the content, how many
//! sections an upload names (none, one, several, and `FileSectionList`'s published
//! maximum), the section labels themselves, how many bytes the upload carries, whether
//! `supportMode` is given and which of its values, and whether the handle a unit of work
//! is reported under fits the modelled bounds of `QuerySummary$query`.
