//! [`inventory_phone_number`] derives the numbers one country and type are offered,
//! [`ComAmazonawsConnectAmazonconnectserviceState::available_phone_numbers`]
//! subtracts the ones already claimed — which is what
//! `SearchAvailablePhoneNumbers` advertises — and
//! [`ComAmazonawsConnectAmazonconnectserviceState::phone_numbers`] is the single
