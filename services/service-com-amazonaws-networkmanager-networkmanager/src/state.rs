//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-networkmanager-networkmanager service.
//!
//! The global-network / site / link lifecycle is the core resource tree of Network
//! Manager: a global network owns sites, a site owns links, and a global network owns
//! devices (each optionally assigned to one of its sites). A device and a link that sit at
//! the same site can be tied together by a LINK ASSOCIATION, which has no id of its own
//! and is therefore keyed by that pair. A device can likewise be tied to a CUSTOMER
//! GATEWAY of Amazon VPC — and, when the request names one, to a link of that device — by a
//! CUSTOMER GATEWAY ASSOCIATION, which has no id either and is keyed by the global network
//! plus the gateway's ARN. Two devices of one global network can instead be
//! tied together by a CONNECTION, which unlike that association IS a resource of its own,
//! with an id, an ARN and tags. A global network also owns its
//! CORE network — the Cloud WAN managed network
//! whose segments and edges are a function of the core network policy document it holds.
//! A core network edge can PEER with a resource of another service (a transit gateway),
//! and a core network in turn owns its ATTACHMENTS: each joins one resource to the edge
//! locations that policy configures — one of them for every kind but a Direct Connect
//! gateway attachment, which spans several — and a Connect attachment is carried over
//! another attachment (its transport) rather than over a resource of its own, and a
//! transit gateway route table attachment over a PEERING — the core network's own
//! connection to a transit gateway, which is a resource of its own with an id, an ARN and
//! tags, and which fixes the core network and the edge location the attachment over it
//! takes. A Connect
//! attachment in turn carries CONNECT PEERS, each a BGP peering between one edge of the
//! core network and one appliance outside AWS, and each a resource of its own with an id,
//! an ARN and tags. A Connect peer can in turn be ASSOCIATED with one device of the global
//! network that owns its core network, optionally over one of that device's links: like a
//! link association that tie has no id of its own and is keyed by the peer it ties. The
//! policy's
//! `attachment-policies` rules decide what becomes of each attachment created on the core
//! network — which segment or network function group it joins, and whether its attachment
//! request has to be ACCEPTED first, which is what holds it in
//! `PENDING_ATTACHMENT_ACCEPTANCE` until `AcceptAttachment` grants that acceptance. A
//! Connect attachment in turn owns the CONNECT PEERS built on it: each is one BGP peering
//! between that attachment's edge of the core network and an appliance.
//! Beside that tree a global network holds the telemetry-bearing connections registered
//! with it (a Connect peer of either kind, a VPN connection), whose session health is what
//! `GetNetworkTelemetry` reports.
//! A global network also holds the TRANSIT GATEWAYS registered with it: each registration
//! is the tie between the global network and one transit gateway of Amazon VPC, with no id
//! of its own, so it is keyed by that pair like a customer gateway association. A CONNECT
//! PEER of such a gateway can in turn be tied to one device of that global network, and
//! optionally to one of that device's links, by a TRANSIT GATEWAY CONNECT PEER ASSOCIATION,
//! which has no id either and is keyed by the global network plus the peer's own ARN; that
//! tie is what registers the peering with the global network's telemetry.
//! A global network also holds the ROUTE ANALYSES started on it: each is a Route Analyzer
//! job that analysed the routing path between two attachments against what the global
//! network held when it was started, and holds the paths it found for `GetRouteAnalysis`
//! to read back.
//! Any resource of a global network's network-resource inventory can in turn carry
//! METADATA — the key/value map `UpdateNetworkResourceMetadata` stores for it and
//! `GetNetworkResources` reports beside its definition — held under that resource's own ARN.
//! Everything
//! the implemented operations answer is computed from the records below — no handler
//! echoes its input back without storing it.
