//! The `com-amazonaws-invoicing-invoicing` service: how it claims requests and how it words the
//! failures the framework hands back.
//!
//! EDIT THIS FILE. It is emitted once with working defaults and is never
//! regenerated, so a choice made here survives adding another service or
//! re-running the generator.
//!
//! `EmulatedService` is what the router mounts (`EmulatedService::new(engine)`).
//! It wraps the generated [`ServiceDefinition`], which carries the model-derived half
//! of this service — its identity, its wire protocol, and its operation routing
//! table — built from the Smithy model at compile time. You do not edit the
//! entry; you edit the behavioral seams below.
//!
//! Six opt-in seams are yours to change; every one defaults to the framework's
//! own behaviour, so an unedited service still routes and answers correctly:
//!
//! - `can_handle` — which requests this service claims. The default matches the
//!   request's resolved route key against this service's signing name. Edit it
//!   for anything the model does not express: a signing name shared by several
//!   services, or routing that keys on the access-key id.
//! - `override_operation` — serve a request the model's routing key cannot name
//!   correctly. The default returns `None`, so every request resolves through the
//!   generated routing table. This service returns `Some` for every operation it
//!   serves, so that a refused input is stated in the modelled
//!   `ValidationException` and the tag plane announces its own media type (see
//!   [`FrontDoor`]), and for a fetch of an invoice document, which is not an API
//!   call at all (see [`invoice_document`]).
//! - `override_refusal` — how this service words a request the framework refused
//!   before any handler ran. The default returns `None`, keeping the framework's
//!   wording; this service words it itself, through the one formatter in
//!   [`validation`] that also words the modelled refusal body [`FrontDoor`] answers
//!   with. See the inline note on that method.
//! - `override_routing_error` — how this service words a request that reached it
//!   but named no modeled operation. The default returns `None`, so the entry
//!   renders the protocol-correct default (query -> 400 InvalidAction, awsJson ->
//!   404, …). Return `Some(resp)` to answer in your own envelope if desired.
//! - `override_framework_error` — how this service words a transport-level
//!   failure the orchestrator detects up front (e.g. a malformed `aws-chunked`
//!   body). The default returns `None`, keeping the entry's protocol-correct
//!   rendering. Return `Some(resp)` to reword it if desired.
//! - `override_protocol` — the codec this service's own responses are serialized
//!   in. The default returns `None`, keeping the model-derived protocol; this
//!   service overrides it (see "The media type this service announces" below).
//!
//! The model-derived half of this service — its identity, wire protocol, routing
//! table, and the default error renderers — lives in the generated `ServiceDefinition`
//! and is reached, not edited, through the one `definition` method below. You
//! do not write it; editing the entry would let this file drift from the model.
//!
//! ## The media types this service announces
//!
//! The model declares the `awsJson1_0` protocol trait, but every recorded response of
//! an INVOICE-UNIT operation — a success and a modelled failure its handler raises
//! alike — announces `application/x-amz-json-1.1`, and the media type a client reads
//! is what it keys content negotiation, deserializer selection and any protocol
//! assertion off. `override_protocol` below therefore serves the awsJson `1.1` codec
//! service-wide: the JSON framing is byte-identical to `1.0`, so a request sent with
//! either media type still reads, and only the announced media type changes.
//!
//! The TAG operations — `ListTagsForResource`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource` — are a
//! different plane of this API, and their recorded responses announce the awsJson
//! `1.0` media type the model's protocol trait declares. [`FrontDoor`] therefore
//! stamps [`TAG_PLANE_MEDIA_TYPE`] on what they answer, so each plane announces the
//! media type its own recorded responses carry.
//!
//! A refusal of the REQUEST is not a response the service produced — the input
//! validator in FRONT of the service answers it — so the routing, transport and
//! refusal envelopes keep the media type the model's protocol trait declares, which
//! is the one seam `override_protocol` deliberately does not reach, and which is the
//! media type the recorded refusals carry too.
