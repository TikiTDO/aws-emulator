//! What the public key surface READS its `Id` as, end to end over HTTP.
//!
//! RULE under test: a public key is addressed by an `Id` the model constrains in no way —
//! `GetPublicKey$Id`, `GetPublicKeyConfig$Id`, `UpdatePublicKey$Id` and `DeletePublicKey$Id`
//! are each a plain `string` with no `@pattern` and no `@length`
//! (`smithy_query(query="operation",operation="GetPublicKey,GetPublicKeyConfig,UpdatePublicKey,DeletePublicKey")`)
//! — so which ids were ever issued is a property of the STORE alone. This surface therefore
//! applies no identifier-format gate: every `Id` the store holds no public key for is the key
//! reported ABSENT, `NoSuchPublicKey` (HTTP 404) under this service's one sentence for that
//! condition, and the sentence carries nothing the request submitted.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over — a value's RELATION to this service's
//! identifier namespaces. The point this suite adds to the sibling table in
//! [`crate::refusal_message_fidelity`] is that the values it drives are ids that really do
//! resolve: the key group id below names a key group `GetKeyGroup` answers 200 for, and the
//! public key id below names the key `GetPublicKey` answers 200 for, so each read is shown to
//! resolve its OWN kind's id and to report every other as a key it does not hold, rather than
//! refusing a value nothing could ever have named.
//!
//! The wire harness and the create helpers are the crate's own.
