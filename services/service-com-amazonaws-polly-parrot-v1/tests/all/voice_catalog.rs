//! End-to-end tests for the two rules the voice catalog answers by:
//!
//! * the catalog `DescribeVoices` serves is the set of voices the service offers, which
//!   is what the model's `VoiceId` enum enumerates — so no modelled voice is missing
//!   from an unfiltered or a filtered query, and the voices synthesis accepts are the
//!   same set;
//! * an optional list member of a reported resource is sent only when the resource has
//!   values for it, so a monolingual voice carries NO `AdditionalLanguageCodes` key and
//!   a task that applied no lexicon carries no `LexiconNames` key — not an empty array.
//!
//! Each test checks its rule over a TABLE that spans the class: every modelled voice,
//! every modelled language, every modelled engine, and tasks with and without each
//! optional list.
