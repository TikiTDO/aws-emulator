//! @op StartSpeechSynthesisStream
//!
//! `POST /v1/synthesisStream -> 200`. Opens a bidirectional synthesis stream:
//! reads the synthesis parameters off the request headers, consumes the
//! `TextEvent` / `CloseStreamEvent` action events the caller frames into the
//! request body, and answers with the modelled `AudioEvent` frames for the text it
//! was sent followed by the `StreamClosedEvent` that closes the stream.
//!
//! ## How the speech is produced
//!
//! Each `AudioEvent` carries speech RENDERED from the text it covers, by the same
//! synthesiser [`super::synthesize_speech`] uses and from the same parts: the text is
//! read into phonemes, the lexicons the request names and the SSML each `TextEvent`
//! carries are applied, and the result is produced by a formant synthesiser and encoded
//! in the format the request asked for. So one stream's audio for a text is the audio
//! the single-shot operation answers for that same text, and nothing is echoed back.
//!
//! Everything around the synthesis is computed from the request and from state, and
//! is the same rule the single-shot sibling applies, so the two operations cannot
//! disagree:
//!
//! * `Engine` admits only the engine the model documents for this operation —
//!   "currently, only the `generative` engine is supported"
//!   ([`STREAMING_ENGINE`]) — and the voice the request names must support it, as
//!   the voice catalog `DescribeVoices` serves records it;
//! * `OutputFormat` admits the AUDIO formats only, because "Amazon Polly does not
//!   support JSON speech marks" on this operation, and this stream carries audio
//!   chunks;
//! * `SampleRate` is accepted only when it is one of the spellings the chosen
//!   format enumerates ([`super::synthesize_speech::valid_sample_rates`]), and
//!   defaults per format and engine the same way;
//! * every name in `LexiconNames` is resolved in the lexicon store of the Region
//!   the request was signed for, and its lexemes are applied to the text that is
//!   spoken;
//! * `LanguageCode` selects which language a bilingual voice speaks and states no
//!   requirement on the voice, so a language the chosen voice does not speak is
//!   streamed with that voice rather than refused;
//! * each `TextEvent` is billed the way Amazon Polly bills characters — every
//!   character of plain text, and for `ssml` the text content only — and `ssml`
//!   text is read as a real XML document and checked against the SSML vocabulary
//!   Amazon Polly publishes, so a document that is not well-formed, or markup
//!   outside that vocabulary, is refused rather than synthesised;
//! * `StreamClosedEvent$RequestCharacters` is "the total number of characters
//!   synthesized during the streaming session" — the sum of those billed counts.
//!
//! `mp3` is the one format whose chunks carry silence rather than the rendered
//! waveform, for the encoder-licence reason [`super::synthesize_speech::legacy_audio`]
//! states; its chunks still last as long as the speech does.
//!
//! ## Where the audio events fall
//!
//! `TextEvent$FlushStreamConfiguration` decides that: it "specifies whether to
//! force the synthesis engine to immediately write buffered audio data to the
//! output stream". So the billed characters of each `TextEvent` accumulate, and the
//! accumulated audio is written as ONE `AudioEvent` at each flush point — a
//! `TextEvent` whose `FlushStreamConfiguration$Force` is set, and the end of the
//! input stream, where `CloseStreamEvent` says "all audio will be returned". A
//! stream that forces no flush therefore answers with the audio of its whole text
//! in one chunk, which is the audio `SynthesizeSpeech` answers for that same text.
//!
//! ## Why this operation is hand-authored
//!
//! Its input carries a `@streaming` event-stream member and its output is a
//! `@streaming` union. The op-stub generator declines the first
//! (`src/ops/SKIPPED_STUBS.md`) and the generated `ErasedOperation` shim declines
//! the second, because `serialize_as_event_stream<P>` needs a `Sized` protocol that
//! an object-safe `run` cannot hand it. The framing, the request reader, the
//! response and the routing seam are the shared ones in
//! `service_common::event_stream`; `src/service.rs` routes a request here through
//! `Service::override_operation`, which the router consults BEFORE the generated
//! routing table. Two things are local to this file, both because the shared module
//! has nothing for them. The ONE frame written here is the `AudioEvent`:
//! `AudioChunk` is that event's `@eventPayload`, so the frame payload is the raw
//! chunk rather than a JSON object carrying a member, which the protocol's generic
//! event serializer cannot express. And the two READERS a streaming input needs —
//! the header-bound half of the request, and one frame's payload — are driven
//! through the shared `deserialize_request` here, the same way
//! `service-com-amazonaws-transcribestreaming-transcribe` drives them in its own
//! crate; the generic home for both is that shared module, whose header already
//! books that migration together with the Transcribe Streaming copies.
//!
//! ## Input (every member an `@httpHeader` except the payload)
//!
//! * `Engine` (Engine: generative | long-form | neural | standard) **required**
//! * `OutputFormat` (OutputFormat: json | mp3 | ogg_opus | ogg_vorbis | pcm |
//!   mulaw | alaw) **required**
//! * `VoiceId` (VoiceId) **required**
//! * `LanguageCode` (LanguageCode), `LexiconNames` (list, len 0..5), `SampleRate`
//!   (string)
//! * `ActionStream` (`@httpPayload`, `@streaming` union of `TextEvent`,
//!   `CloseStreamEvent`)
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `EventStream` (`@httpPayload`, `@streaming` union of `AudioEvent`,
//!   `StreamClosedEvent`, and the four errors below as in-band exceptions) — the
//!   response body, HTTP 200.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ValidationException` (HTTP 400) — "the input fails to satisfy the constraints
//!   specified by the service", with the `reason` naming the class:
//!   `fieldValidationFailed` for a header the rules above refuse,
//!   `invalidInboundEvent` for an action event the input union does not admit or
//!   that is not valid, and `other` for a stream past this emulator's capacity.
//! * `ServiceFailureException` (HTTP 500) — this service's own state is unreachable.
//! * `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 400) and `ServiceQuotaExceededException` (HTTP 402)
//!   are modelled and declared, and nothing here constructs either: see the note on
//!   each shape in `super::types`.
