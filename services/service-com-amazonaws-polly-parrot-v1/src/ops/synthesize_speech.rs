//! @op SynthesizeSpeech
//! Serves one synthesis request: resolves the lexicons it names, settles the output
//! encoding and returns an audio stream in it.
//!
//! ## How the speech is produced
//!
//! The `AudioStream` is RENDERED from the text, in this process. The text is read into
//! phonemes by English spelling rules ([`phonemes`]), the lexicons the request names and
//! the SSML it carries are applied to that reading ([`plan`]), and the resulting timed
//! sequence of phonemes is produced by a formant synthesiser — a glottal source and the
//! resonances of the vocal tract ([`render`]) — then written in the encoding
//! `OutputFormat` asked for ([`audio`]). Nothing is echoed back, no bytes are matched
//! against the input and no stored audio exists: the waveform follows from what the
//! request says, so changing the text, a lexicon, the markup or the voice changes the
//! samples.
//!
//! Everything AROUND the synthesis is computed from the request and from state the same
//! way:
//!
//! * every name in `LexiconNames` is resolved in the lexicon store of the Region the
//!   request was signed for, and a name that Region does not store is
//!   `LexiconNotFoundException` (404);
//! * `Engine` is checked against the voice the request names, as the voice catalog
//!   `DescribeVoices` serves records it, so the two operations cannot disagree: an
//!   engine the voice does not support is the request-shape refusal
//!   `ValidationException` (which is what Amazon Polly answers for it, not the modelled
//!   `EngineNotSupportedException`). A voice the seeded catalog does not carry is not
//!   narrowed, because that catalog is a stated subset. `LanguageCode` is NOT such a
//!   check: it selects which language a bilingual voice speaks and states no
//!   requirement on the voice, so a language the chosen voice does not speak is
//!   synthesized with that voice in its own language rather than refused;
//! * `ContentType` is the `OutputFormat`'s documented media type;
//! * `ssml` input is read as an XML DOCUMENT — exactly one root element, and nothing
//!   but whitespace, comments and processing instructions around it — and checked
//!   against the SSML vocabulary Amazon Polly publishes — its
//!   tag set, each tag's attributes and each attribute's value domain (see
//!   [`ssml::SUPPORTED_ELEMENTS`]) — so a document that is not well-formed, or markup
//!   outside that vocabulary, is `InvalidSsmlException` rather than a green light for a
//!   document the real service refuses;
//! * `RequestCharacters` is the billed character count — every character of plain
//!   text, and for `ssml` the text content only, because "SSML tags are not counted
//!   as billed characters";
//! * `SampleRate` is a string whose domain the model enumerates per format, so it is
//!   accepted only when it is one of those spellings exactly, and defaults per format
//!   and engine the same way;
//! * the text limits (6000 total / 3000 billed characters) are enforced;
//! * `json` output is the speech-mark stream of the same utterance, in all four modelled
//!   types: `sentence` and `word` carry the byte offsets and the text they cover in
//!   `Text`, `viseme` carries the mouth shape of each phoneme as it is spoken and `ssml`
//!   carries each `<mark>` the document placed, each at the time the renderer produces
//!   it; a request naming no mark type gets an empty stream, for every `TextType`,
//!   rather than a refusal Amazon Polly does not declare.
//!
//! Two formats are not rendered: `mp3` needs an MPEG Layer III encoder, whose only
//! published Rust binding is under a licence this project cannot take, and `ogg_opus`
//! needs an Opus encoder, which no binding available to this image can build. Each
//! carries its own real framing around silence, lasting as long as the speech does — see
//! [`legacy_audio`], where that is stated rather than dressed up.
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `SynthesizeSpeech::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `SynthesizeSpeech`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-polly-parrot-v1/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-polly-parrot-v1.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Synthesizes UTF-8 input, plain text or SSML, to a stream of bytes. SSML input must be
//! valid, well-formed SSML. Some alphabets might not be available with all the voices (for
//! example, Cyrillic might not be read at all by English voices) unless phoneme mapping is
//! used. For more information, see How it Works.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `Engine` (Engine, one of: generative | long-form | neural | standard) — Specifies the
//!   engine (standard, neural, long-form, or generative) for Amazon Polly to use when
//!   processing input text for speech synthesis. Provide an engine that is supported by the
//!   voice you select. If you don't provide an engine, the standard engine is selected by
//!   default. If a chosen voice isn't supported by the standard engine, this will result in
//!   an error. For information on Amazon Polly voices and which voices are available for each
//!   engine, see Available Voices.
//! * `LanguageCode` (LanguageCode, one of: ar-AE | arb | ca-ES | cmn-CN | cs-CZ | cy-GB |
//!   da-DK | de-AT | de-CH | de-DE | en-AU | en-GB | en-GB-WLS | en-IE | en-IN | en-NZ |
//!   en-SG | en-US | en-ZA | es-ES | es-MX | es-US | fi-FI | fr-BE | fr-CA | fr-FR | hi-IN |
//!   is-IS | it-IT | …) — Optional language code for the Synthesize Speech request. This is
//!   only necessary if using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for either
//!   Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN). If a bilingual voice is used and no language
//!   code is specified, Amazon Polly uses the default language of the bilingual voice. The
//!   default language for any voice is the one returned by the DescribeVoices operation for
//!   the LanguageCode parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will
//!   use Indian English rather than Hindi.
//! * `LexiconNames` (LexiconNameList, len 0..5) — List of one or more pronunciation lexicon
//!   names you want the service to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if the
//!   language of the lexicon is the same as the language of the voice. For information about
//!   storing lexicons, see PutLexicon.
//! * `OutputFormat` (OutputFormat, one of: alaw | json | mp3 | mulaw | ogg_opus | ogg_vorbis
//!   | pcm) **required** — The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For audio
//!   stream, this will be mp3, ogg_vorbis, ogg_opus, mu-law, a-law or pcm. For speech marks,
//!   this will be json. When pcm is used, the content returned is audio/pcm in a signed
//!   16-bit, 1 channel (mono), little-endian format.
//! * `SampleRate` (SampleRate) — The audio frequency specified in Hz. The valid values for
//!   mp3 and ogg_vorbis are "8000", "16000", "22050", "24000", "44100" and "48000". The
//!   default value for standard voices is "22050". The default value for neural voices is
//!   "24000". The default value for long-form voices is "24000". The default value for
//!   generative voices is "24000". Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default
//!   value is "16000". Valid value for ogg_opus is "48000". Valid value for mu-law and a-law
//!   is "8000".
//! * `SpeechMarkTypes` (SpeechMarkTypeList, len 0..4) — The type of speech marks returned for
//!   the input text.
//! * `Text` (Text) **required** — Input text to synthesize. If you specify ssml as the
//!   TextType, follow the SSML format for the input text.
//! * `TextType` (TextType, one of: ssml | text) — Specifies whether the input text is plain
//!   text or SSML. The default value is plain text. For more information, see Using SSML.
//! * `VoiceId` (VoiceId, one of: Aditi | Adriano | Ambre | Amy | Andres | Aria | Arjun |
//!   Arlet | Arthur | Astrid | Ayanda | Beatrice | Bianca | Brian | Burcu | Camila | Carla |
//!   Carlos | Carmen | Carolina | Celine | Chantal | Conchita | Cristiano | Curtis | Daniel |
//!   …) **required** — Voice ID to use for the synthesis. You can get a list of available
//!   voice IDs by calling the DescribeVoices operation.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `AudioStream` (AudioStream, default "") **required** — Stream containing the synthesized
//!   speech.
//! * `ContentType` (ContentType) — Specifies the type audio stream. This should reflect the
//!   OutputFormat parameter in your request. If you request mp3 as the OutputFormat, the
//!   ContentType returned is audio/mpeg. If you request ogg_vorbis as the OutputFormat, the
//!   ContentType returned is audio/ogg. If you request ogg_opus as the OutputFormat, the
//!   ContentType returned is audio/ogg. If you request pcm as the OutputFormat, the
//!   ContentType returned is audio/pcm in a signed 16-bit, 1 channel (mono), little-endian
//!   format. If you request mu-law as the OutputFormat, the ContentType returned is
//!   audio/mulaw. If you request a-law as the OutputFormat, the ContentType returned is
//!   audio/alaw. If you request json as the OutputFormat, the …
//! * `RequestCharacters` (RequestCharacters, default 0) **required** — Number of characters
//!   synthesized.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `EngineNotSupportedException` (HTTP 400) — This engine is not compatible with the voice
//!   that you have designated. Choose a new voice that is compatible with the engine or
//!   change the engine and restart the operation.
//! * `InvalidSampleRateException` (HTTP 400) — The specified sample rate is not valid.
//! * `InvalidSsmlException` (HTTP 400) — The SSML you provided is invalid. Verify the SSML
//!   syntax, spelling of tags and values, and then try again.
//! * `LanguageNotSupportedException` (HTTP 400) — The language specified is not currently
//!   supported by Amazon Polly in this capacity.
//! * `LexiconNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — Amazon Polly can't find the specified lexicon.
//!   This could be caused by a lexicon that is missing, its name is misspelled or specifying
//!   a lexicon that is in a different region. Verify that the lexicon exists, is in the
//!   region (see ListLexicons) and that you spelled its name is spelled correctly. Then try
//!   again.
//! * `MarksNotSupportedForFormatException` (HTTP 400) — Speech marks are not supported for
//!   the OutputFormat selected. Speech marks are only available for content in json format.
//! * `ServiceFailureException` (HTTP 500) — An unknown condition has caused a service
//!   failure.
//! * `SsmlMarksNotSupportedForTextTypeException` (HTTP 400) — SSML speech marks are not
//!   supported for plain text-type input.
//! * `TextLengthExceededException` (HTTP 400) — The value of the "Text" parameter is longer
//!   than the accepted limits. For the SynthesizeSpeech API, the limit for input text is a
//!   maximum of 6000 characters total, of which no more than 3000 can be billed characters.
//!   For the StartSpeechSynthesisTask API, the maximum is 200,000 characters, of which no
//!   more than 100,000 can be billed characters. SSML tags are not counted as billed
//!   characters.
