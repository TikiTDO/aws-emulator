//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-polly-parrot-v1 service.
//!
//! Three stores live here, and every handler reaches them through [`service_state`]:
//!
//! * [`ComAmazonawsPollyParrotV1State::lexicons`] — the pronunciation lexicons
//!   `PutLexicon` writes and `GetLexicon`, `ListLexicons`, `DeleteLexicon` and
//!   `SynthesizeSpeech` read. Keyed by [`LexiconKey`] — the Region the lexicon was
//!   put in, then its name — in a `BTreeMap`, so one Region's lexicons sit
//!   contiguously in name order and `ListLexicons` reads them with a range scan
//!   without sorting on every call. Reach them through the accessors on the state
//!   rather than through the map, so no operation can read past its own Region.
//! * [`ComAmazonawsPollyParrotV1State::voices`] — the voice catalog `DescribeVoices`
//!   serves. Seeded once from [`VOICE_CATALOG`] when the state is first touched and
//!   never written at runtime; Amazon Polly models no operation that mutates it. A
//!   request may name a voice the catalog does not list, so a `VoiceId` is resolved
//!   through [`ComAmazonawsPollyParrotV1State::voice`] rather than over that field.
//! * [`ComAmazonawsPollyParrotV1State::synthesis_tasks`] — the asynchronous speech
//!   synthesis tasks `StartSpeechSynthesisTask` creates and
//!   `GetSpeechSynthesisTask` and `ListSpeechSynthesisTasks` report. Keyed by
//!   `TaskId` in a `BTreeMap`, so the list read is ordered and paginable the same way.
//!   A task is kept for the documented [`TASK_RETENTION`] window and no longer, so
//!   every task read reaches the store through
//!   [`ComAmazonawsPollyParrotV1State::retained_synthesis_tasks`], which materialises
//!   what the clock already owes it.
//!
//! The state also carries the secret the paginated reads mint their `NextToken`s under
//! ([`PageTokenKey`]), which is what lets a read tell a continuation token this service
//! issued from one a caller built.

/// (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="VoiceId")`), every `language_code` a value of
/// its `LanguageCode` enum, every `gender` a value of `Gender` and every entry of
/// `supported_engines` a value of `Engine`; the voice names, the language names and the
/// voice→language→engine assignments come from the AWS "Available voices" table
/// linked from `SynthesizeSpeech$Engine`'s documentation.
///
/// A voice's `name` is the name that table spells, diacritics included, and its `id` is
/// "the ASCII version of the voice name" (`DescribeVoices`) — which is why the eight
/// voices whose own names carry diacritics are the only rows whose `name` and `id`
/// differ. `language_name` is the language's name in English as that table names it
/// (so `de-CH` is "Swiss Standard German", not "Swiss German"), and one language is
/// named the same way by every voice that speaks it.
///
/// `Aditi` carries `hi-IN` as an additional language code because
/// `Voice$AdditionalLanguageCodes`'s own documentation states it: "the default
/// language for Aditi is Indian English (en-IN) ... this parameter would show the
/// code `hi-IN`" — which is the rule for every bilingual voice: its `language_code` is
/// the language it was first used for and its additional codes are the other languages
/// it speaks, so `hi-IN` and `arb` are reported as additional languages of the Indian
/// English and Gulf Arabic voices rather than as those voices' default language.
///
/// The catalog is the voices the service OFFERS, which is what this operation reports
/// — "the list of voices that are available for use when requesting speech synthesis".
/// The model's `VoiceId` enum is WIDER than it: the enum is the set of ids a request
/// may name, and it carries ids of voices the offered table does not list.
/// [`UNLISTED_VOICES`] holds those, so a request naming one is still resolved against
/// the voice it names rather than against nothing, and no voice the catalog reports is
/// hidden from a filtered query.
