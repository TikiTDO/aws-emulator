//! End-to-end HTTP tests for DataZone subscription requests: `CreateSubscriptionRequest`
//! and the reader it round-trips through, `GetSubscriptionRequestDetails`.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — a real `restJson1` request
//! through the router — and uses only the response body as evidence, so a handler that
//! answered from a hardcoded value instead of from the store would fail here.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. A subscription request is RECORDED in its domain: the create answers the stored
//!    record — `PENDING`, the calling principal as `createdBy`, the reason asked for, the
//!    subscribed principal resolved against the domain, and the subscribed listing at the
//!    revision the catalog held — and `GetSubscriptionRequestDetails` reads back exactly
//!    that record, as often as it is asked.
//! 2. The preconditions are refused with the operation's own modelled errors: an
//!    identifier the store serves no domain for with `AccessDeniedException`, an unsettled
//!    domain with `ConflictException`, a listing or a principal the domain does not hold
//!    with `ResourceNotFoundException`, and a request whose shape no modelled constraint
//!    covers with `ValidationException`.
//! 3. A repeated `clientToken` records ONE request, and a different one records another.
//! 4. An `assetScopes` entry is reported back with the verdict of the filters it names,
//!    and an `assetPermissions` entry with the permissions asked for — both on the asset
//!    they name.
