//! The VPC peering connection store: what one peering is stored as, the state the clock
//! owes a fresh request, when an unaccepted request expires, the store's bounds and the
//! error channel the peering operations share.
//!
//! A peering connection is a resource BETWEEN two VPCs — "Requests a VPC peering
//! connection between two VPCs: a requester VPC that you own and an accepter VPC with
//! which to create the connection" (`CreateVpcPeeringConnection`) — so the record holds
//! the facts OF the peering (which two VPCs, whose accounts, which Regions, its status and
//! its tags) and nothing that belongs to a VPC. The address space of each side is read off
//! the VPC the store holds, at the moment it is reported
//! ([`ComAmazonawsEc2Amazonec2State::vpc_peering_connection_view`]), rather than copied
//! onto this record: a VPC that takes another CIDR block afterwards cannot then be
//! described two ways.
//!
//! What the peering operations share lives here — the id mint, the status words, the
//! `initiating-request` -> `pending-acceptance` move the clock owes a fresh request, the
//! expiry of a request nobody answered, the ceilings and the refusals — so no two of them
//! can report one connection differently.
