//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-securityhub-securityhubapiservice service.
//!
//! Security Hub CSPM is subscribed per account **and** Region: `EnableSecurityHub`
//! creates the single `hub/default` resource for the caller's account/Region, and
//! `DisableSecurityHub` removes it together with the findings imported into it. The
//! state below therefore keys the hub on `(account id, Region)` and every finding on
//! `(account id, Region, ProductArn, Id)` — `ProductArn` + `Id` is the modelled
//! `AwsSecurityFindingIdentifier`, the identity `BatchUpdateFindings` addresses a
//! finding by, and the account/Region prefix is what makes "disable removes this
//! account's findings in this Region" expressible.
//!
//! A custom insight `CreateInsight` creates is keyed the same way — `(account id,
//! Region, InsightArn)` — because an insight is a saved query over exactly the
//! findings of the hub it was created in, so disabling the hub takes it with it.
