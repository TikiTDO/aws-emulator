//! A resource of this service exists in exactly ONE Region.
//!
//! The rule these cases assert: Connector for SCEP is a regional service, so a connector —
//! and the challenges and tags it owns — exists only in the Region named by its own ARN
//! (`ConnectorArn` / `ChallengeArn` carry a Region segment, smithy_query shape=ConnectorArn),
//! which is the Region the create was signed for. A call signed for any other Region
//! therefore neither lists nor resolves it: the listing omits it, and every operation that
//! identifies it by ARN answers as though it did not exist — a read with
//! `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) carrying that ARN as `ResourceId` and the kind of
//! resource it names as `ResourceType`, a tagging call with the tagging layer's own not-found
//! refusal, a delete with the accepted no-op its 202 output is — and writes nothing.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does, one HTTP request per call through the
//! same `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator boots, with the Region in the request's own SigV4
//! credential scope. The table's rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which
//! Region owns the resource, which Region the foreign call is signed for (including a pair
//! whose names sort adjacently, so an ARN-ordered walk of one Region would run straight into
//! the other), the private CA the connector links, and how many challenges the connector
//! holds.
