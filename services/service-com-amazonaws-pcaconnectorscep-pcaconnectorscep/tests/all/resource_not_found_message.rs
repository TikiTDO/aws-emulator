//! Every `ResourceNotFoundException` this service answers is worded the same way.
//!
//! The rule under test: the error's required `Message` is not free text — it is the
//! `ResourceType` the error carries, the fixed words `" was not found: "`, the `ResourceId`,
//! and a terminating `.` (smithy_query: shape ResourceNotFoundException, whose three members
//! are all required). The two variable parts come from the request and from state, and they
//! are exactly the error's other two members, so the sentence and the fields report the same
//! two facts. `ResourceType` is what the request named and this service could not find: the
//! kind of resource (`Connector` or `Challenge`) for a call addressed AT that resource, and
//! the name of the input member that referenced it on `CreateChallenge`, whose own resource
//! is the challenge it creates rather than the connector it was handed.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does, one HTTP request per call through the
//! same `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator boots. The rows differ along what the rule
//! generalises over: which operation raises the error, which resource kind the ARN names, HOW
//! the ARN came to name nothing (never created, deleted, owner torn down, an id under a live
//! owner), the partition and Region segments of the ARN, the resource ids, and how many other
//! records are stored when the call arrives. The five recorded read paths are five of the
//! rows.
