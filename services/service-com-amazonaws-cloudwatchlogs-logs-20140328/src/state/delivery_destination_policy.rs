//! What makes a document a DELIVERY DESTINATION POLICY — the cross-account grant
//! `PutDeliveryDestinationPolicy` assigns to one of this account's delivery destinations — and
//! the form that document is stored and reported in.

use super::*;

/// Whether `document` is a delivery destination resource policy.
///
/// The operation "creates and assigns an IAM policy that grants permissions to CloudWatch Logs
/// to deliver logs cross-account", so the document is first an IAM JSON policy in its
/// RESOURCE-based form — it states who the permission is granted to — which is the one grammar
/// [`service_common::iam_policy`] states for every service of this emulator that takes such a
/// document.
///
/// Beyond that grammar the document has to be THIS grant rather than some other resource's
/// policy, which is what the operation's own documentation states it is: a policy whose
/// "contents must include two statements. One statement enables general logs delivery, and the
/// other allows delivery to the chosen destination", assigned "in the destination account" so
/// that another account may "deliver logs cross-account to a specified destination in this
/// account". So each of its statements is a grant of log delivery:
///
/// * it names the RESOURCE it grants access to, and every resource it names is one of the
///   vended-log delivery resources ([`names_a_delivery_resource`]) — the destination being
///   assigned to, its siblings, the delivery sources paired with them, or the deliveries
///   themselves. A statement about something else (a log group, a bucket, a stream) belongs to
///   THAT resource's policy, where it would be effective, rather than to a delivery
///   destination, where it grants nothing.
/// * every ACTION it names is one of the vended-log delivery actions
///   ([`names_a_delivery_action`]): those are the operations that act on those resources, so an
///   action outside them can never be exercised against the destination.
/// * it grants them to an ACCOUNT ([`grants_to_an_account`]), because what this policy enables
///   is another account's calls against this account's destination.
///
/// What a statement SAYS beyond that is not judged: which of the delivery actions a grant
/// covers, which account it names and what it conditions them on govern a cross-account
/// delivery nothing in this store performs.
