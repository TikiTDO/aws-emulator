//! Fan-out of ingested log events to a log group's subscription-filter destinations.
//!
//! `PutSubscriptionFilter` configures "a real-time stream of log events ingested through
//! PutLogEvents" and has them "delivered to a specific destination", and it states what
//! the receiving service is handed: "When log events are sent to the receiving service,
//! they are Base64 encoded and compressed with the GZIP format." So an event a
//! `PutLogEvents` batch STORES is offered to every subscription filter of its log group,
//! the filter's own `filterPattern` decides which of the batch's events it carries, and
//! the ones it carries travel as gzip-framed JSON — the CloudWatch Logs subscription
//! envelope, whose members are the owner account, the log group, the log stream, the
//! filter name that selected the events and the events themselves ([`envelope`]).
//!
//! The envelope carries each event's message as the filter is configured to see it: as it
//! was INGESTED by default, and — for a filter put with `applyOnTransformedLogs` on a log
//! group that has an active transformer — the version that transformer produced
//! ([`super::transformer`]), which is both what the filter's own `filterPattern` is run
//! against and what the envelope carries, because it is the version the filter was applied
//! to. The event the group STORED is untouched either way, so `GetLogEvents` reports the
//! ingested bytes whether the group transforms or not. A log group's
//! `kmsKeyId` names the key the group's own stored log data is encrypted with
//! (`AssociateKmsKey`: "Associates the specified KMS key with either one log group in the
//! account, or with all stored CloudWatch Logs query insights results in the account"); it
//! is not a property of any subscription destination and no operation copies it to one, so
//! a filter on a group that names a key delivers the same envelope as a filter on a group
//! that names none.
//!
//! The four destination kinds are the ones `PutSubscriptionFilter$destinationArn`
//! documents, and each takes the envelope the way its own API accepts a payload:
//!
//! * a Kinesis data stream — one record per envelope, the gzip frame as its data;
//! * a Firehose delivery stream — one record per envelope, likewise;
//! * a Lambda function — invoked with the `awslogs` document, which carries the gzip frame
//!   base64-encoded, this being the one destination whose payload states that encoding
//!   itself rather than leaving it to a blob member's wire form;
//! * a CloudWatch Logs logical destination created with `PutDestination` — "a logical
//!   object that represents the actual delivery destination", so it is resolved to the
//!   `targetArn` it names ("the physical target where the log events are delivered (for
//!   example, a Kinesis stream)") and the envelope is delivered THERE.
//!
//! Each destination service is reached the way any emulated service reaches another: its
//! AWS SDK client driven over the in-process callback
//! ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext::callback`]), so nothing here opens a socket
//! or leaves the host and this crate names no other service crate.
//!
//! A delivery is also made AS THIS SERVICE'S OWN SERVICE PRINCIPAL, acting for the log group
//! the events were ingested into ([`as_the_service_principal`]), because one destination
//! asks who is calling: a Firehose delivery stream whose destination enables the CloudWatch
//! Logs pipeline takes records from CloudWatch Logs and from no other producer ("Only
//! requests from CloudWatch Logs are supported when CloudWatch Logs decompression is
//! enabled"), and the credential a call presents is what says whose call it is
//! ([`::service_common::service_principal_calls`]).
//!
//! Every write to a destination is made UNDER A ROLE where the filter's configuration names
//! one, and is authorized against that role before it is attempted
//! ([`withheld_by_delivery_role`]). `PutSubscriptionFilter$roleArn` is "the ARN of an IAM role
//! that grants CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination
//! stream" and a logical destination carries the same thing for the target it names
//! (`Destination$roleArn`, "a role for impersonation, used when delivering log events to the
//! target"), so the envelope reaches the destination only where the permissions in force on
//! that role allow the destination service's own write action ([`DELIVERY_ACTIONS`]) on the
//! destination resource — the question IAM itself answers
//! ([`service_common::iam_role::role_withholds_action`]). A role that allows it nothing
//! delivers nothing, and the withheld envelope is accounted for exactly as one the
//! destination would not take ([`DELIVERY_ERRORS_METRIC`]), since no record reached the
//! destination either way. A configuration that names NO role — which is every Lambda
//! destination, "you don't need to provide the ARN when you are working with a logical
//! destination for cross-account delivery" — is governed by what authorizes that destination
//! instead, so nothing is withheld here for it.
//!
//! A filter's destination is also written to when the filter is CONFIGURED rather than when
//! anything is ingested: `PutSubscriptionFilter` validates a STREAM destination it was
//! handed by putting one health-check record on it ([`health_check`]), which is the one
//! signal a client has at wiring time that the destination it named is reachable. A Lambda
//! destination is validated by its own resource policy instead and is never invoked by the
//! configuration call ([`CONTROL_MESSAGE_DESTINATIONS`]).
//!
//! Delivery is best effort, as it is for the real service: `PutLogEvents` "always
//! accepted" the batch, and whether a destination took the envelope is not part of its
//! answer, so a destination that refuses or does not exist leaves the ingestion standing.
//! What it does answer with is TELEMETRY, the only place a client can observe the outcome of
//! a delivery it did not make itself: the events a filter forwarded are counted as the
//! service's own [`FORWARDED_LOG_EVENTS_METRIC`] and a destination that would not take an
//! envelope as [`DELIVERY_ERRORS_METRIC`], both in [`super::emf::LOGS_NAMESPACE`] under the
//! dimensions of the filter that owes the delivery ([`DELIVERY_DIMENSIONS`]), published into
//! the same metric store `ListMetrics` and `GetMetricStatistics` read. A destination that
//! refused is also marked on the filter, which stops attempting it until the next
//! `PutSubscriptionFilter` re-validates it — so the events written during an outage stay
//! readable in the log group and are never re-delivered once the destination returns.
//!
//! What one ingestion can cost is bounded by what the batch and the group already bound: a
//! log group holds at most [`super::MAX_SUBSCRIPTION_FILTERS_PER_GROUP`] filters, so a
//! batch owes at most that many envelopes per record-sized run of its events, and each run
//! is capped at [`MAX_RECORD_BYTES`] of the batch's own bytes
//! ([`record_sized_chunks`]) — one request therefore makes a bounded number of bounded
//! calls.
