//! End-to-end tests for `GetDeliveryDestinationPolicy` as a REPORT: what it answers, where
//! it looks for the resource it names, and what it leaves behind.
//!
//! The rule under test: `GetDeliveryDestinationPolicy` answers from stored state — the
//! delivery destination policy the last assignment stored on the delivery destination the
//! request names, and no `policy` member at all for a destination none has been assigned to
//! — resolving that name in the delivery-destination namespace of this account EXACTLY, so a
//! name the account holds no delivery destination under is refused as a missing resource
//! however many other resources of this service carry it; and, being a report, it writes
//! nothing, so repeating it and interleaving it with other reads leaves every caller
//! afterwards — itself included — seeing exactly the state the reads started from.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so what is
//! asserted here is what a client reads off the wire, and a response that is not computed
//! from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than one request: destinations of
//! several `DeliveryDestinationType`s, names at both published bounds of
//! `DeliveryDestinationName`, destinations carrying a policy and destinations carrying none
//! in the same store, policy documents of several forms and character sets, a name held by
//! another kind of resource of this service (a delivery source, a log group and a logical
//! destination) and near-miss spellings of a held name.
//!
//! `tests/all/delivery_destination_policies.rs` is the assignment side of the same state:
//! that a policy is stored and reported as the document the assignment read, replaced by the
//! next assignment, and refused when it is not an IAM policy document.
