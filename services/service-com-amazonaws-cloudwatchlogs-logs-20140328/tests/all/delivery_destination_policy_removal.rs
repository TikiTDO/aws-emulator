//! End-to-end tests for `DeleteDeliveryDestinationPolicy`: taking the delivery destination
//! policy off one of the account's delivery destinations.
//!
//! The rule under test: the policy a delivery destination holds belongs to THAT destination,
//! so deleting it leaves the destination it names holding no policy at all — which is what
//! every later read reports — while every other destination keeps the policy it holds and the
//! named destination keeps every other parameter it was created with; the resource the delete
//! REMOVES is that policy, so a destination holding none has nothing for the delete to remove
//! and the delete is refused as a missing resource however often it is repeated, while a later
//! assignment on the same destination takes effect and can be deleted again; and a
//! `deliveryDestinationName` the account holds no delivery destination under names no resource
//! to delete a policy from, so it is refused as a missing resource too and nothing is
//! persisted.
//!
//! Every case drives the service the way a client does — `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: Logs_20140328.<Operation>` through the router that mounts it — so what is
//! asserted here is what a client reads off the wire, and a response that is not computed
//! from the shared store cannot pass.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over rather than one request: destinations of
//! several `DeliveryDestinationType`s, names at both published bounds of
//! `DeliveryDestinationName`, policy documents of several forms and character sets, and
//! destinations holding no policy at all — all in one store, so a delete that reaches past the
//! destination it names cannot pass.
//!
//! `tests/all/delivery_destination_policies.rs` is the assignment side of the same state and
//! `tests/all/delivery_destination_policy_reads.rs` the reporting side.
