//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-connectcampaignsv2-amazonconnectcampaignservicev2 service.
//!
//! Every record below belongs to ONE region: campaigns and Connect instance
//! configurations are regional resources, reachable only through the endpoint of the
//! region they were created in, so the store keeps one set of records per
//! credential-scope region ([`request_region`]) and every lookup, listing and write
//! takes the region it is serving and resolves inside that region alone.
//!
//! The campaign store is the single source of truth for the campaign lifecycle:
//! `CreateCampaign` writes a record here, `DescribeCampaign` / `ListCampaigns` /
//! `GetCampaignState` project it, `Start`/`Pause`/`Resume`/`StopCampaign` move its
//! [`CampaignState`], and `DeleteCampaign` removes it. No handler keeps a copy of
//! its own, so every response describes what the store holds.
//!
//! A campaign's state is owed to the CLOCK as well as to those calls: a campaign
//! that has entered its run is `Completed` once its schedule's `endTime` has
//! passed, which [`StoredCampaign::state_at`] derives from the stored schedule on
//! every read, so no reader reports a state the schedule has already moved past.
//!
//! The instance-onboarding store beside it is the single source of truth for which
//! Connect instances are onboarded to Campaigns: `StartInstanceOnboardingJob` writes a
//! record here with the encryption config it was given,
//! `GetInstanceOnboardingJobStatus` reports the status that record is at,
//! `GetConnectInstanceConfig` projects the config it holds, and `CreateCampaign`
//! consults it before minting a campaign — an instance with no finished onboarding job
//! is not a campaign target. The instance-wide communication limits live on that same
//! record: `PutInstanceCommunicationLimits` writes them and
//! `GetInstanceCommunicationLimits` reports them, so neither keeps a copy of its own.
//!
//! An onboarding job is owed to the CLOCK like a campaign's state, and it settles on
//! the outcome the call that started it determined: the key its encryption config names
//! is resolved in the KMS store ([`onboarding_encryption_failure`]) when the job starts,
//! so a job the service cannot finish settles `FAILED` carrying the
//! `InstanceOnboardingJobFailureCode` of the dependency that stopped it, which is the
//! record `DeleteInstanceOnboardingJob` clears.
//!
//! The integration store is the single source of truth for what an onboarded Connect
//! instance is integrated with: `PutConnectInstanceIntegration` writes one record per
//! integration the instance holds, keyed by the kind and resource ARN that identify
//! it, `ListConnectInstanceIntegrations` projects those records and
//! `DeleteConnectInstanceIntegration` removes the one its identifier names.
//!
//! `DeleteConnectInstanceConfig` is the other end of onboarding: it removes an
//! instance's record from the onboarding store together with everything held on that
//! configuration — its communication limits and its integrations — so the instance is
//! no longer onboarded and no reader reports a configuration for it. The campaigns of
//! the instance go with it only when the request's campaign deletion policy says so.

// =============================================================================
// The ARNs this service's unions carry
// =============================================================================
//
// A constrained member reaches a handler already checked — unless the UNION MEMBER
// SCHEMA is the only thing that could have carried the constraint, because the
// generated member schemas of a union carry no constraint traits and so the
// centralized walk has nothing to enforce there. That is the case for a union member
// that is a bare STRING, and for one whose own `@length` bounds a list (the reason
// [`communication_limits_violation`] above exists). Where the union member is a
// STRUCTURE, a LIST of structures or a MAP of them, the walk descends and judges each
// structure against its own generated schema, whose member schemas DO carry the
// model's `@length`/`@pattern`, so those leaves arrive checked — a map KEY stays the
// exception, which is what [`communication_time_violation`] above weighs. The value
// behind the union member is judged HERE by that very walk, started one level down:
// `aws_smithy_schema_server::constraints::validate` over a structure behind a union
// member, and the walk's `ValidatingSerializer` over the one union member that is a
// bare string. Same rules and same wording as the boundary, so no record can come to
// hold — and no read project — an ARN the model's own shape forbids.
//
// `ChannelSubtypeConfig` is the union-borne case that rule settles with NO check here,
// which is why no helper for it stands beside the ones above: every member of the four
// `outboundMode` unions, and of the `PacingStrategy` union one level deeper, is a
// STRUCTURE carrying no constraint trait on the union member itself, so the centralized
// walk descends to every leaf behind them — the bandwidth-allocation, target-rate and
// timeout ranges, the pacing-strategy list's `@length`, the agent-action and
// connection-start-point catalogs, the evaluation window's `@pattern` and the
// `@required` members at each depth — and the operations that accept such a config
// (`CreateCampaign`, `UpdateCampaignChannelSubtypeConfig`) are handed one already
// checked. `tests/all/channel_subtype_config_is_one_rule.rs` pins that end to end
// through both of them, so a codegen change that stopped descending past a union
// member fails there rather than letting a campaign come to hold a config the model's
// own shape forbids.
