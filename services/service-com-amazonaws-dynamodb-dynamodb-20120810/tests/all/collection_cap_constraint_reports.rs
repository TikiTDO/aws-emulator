//! How this service reports a COLLECTION input member that is outside the
//! `@length` bound the model declares for it — the batched and transactional
//! caps a client retries against.
//!
//! One rule, over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded request: a
//! collection input member whose element or entry count falls outside its
//! modelled `@length` bound is refused with HTTP 400 `ValidationException`
//! whose message is the `<N> validation error(s) detected: ` envelope over one
//! clause per violated member, and that clause states exactly three facts — the
//! member's dotted input path as the model spells it on the wire, that the
//! member failed a constraint, and the BOUND it broke. It states nothing the
//! emulator computed about the request: not the element count, not a byte
//! total, not the operation that refused it. At the bound the request is not
//! refused as a constraint violation at all.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the operation
//! (transactional read, transactional write, batched read, batched write), the
//! collection's kind (a list of structures, a list of maps, a map of lists), the
//! bound that was broken (the `@length` maximum and the `@length` minimum), the
//! published bound's value (100 and 25), the member's depth in the request (a
//! top-level member and a list nested under a map entry the CALLER keyed), the
//! shape of the elements (a `Get`, a `Put`, a `Delete`, a mix of two actions),
//! and how far past the bound the request went (one past it, and half again as
//! many) — each bound tested AT the bound and one past it.
//!
//! Every bound named in a row comes from the Smithy model, through
//! `smithy_query(query="shape", shape="…")`: `TransactGetItemList` and
//! `TransactWriteItemList` are `@length{min:1,max:100}`, `KeyList` and
//! `BatchGetRequestMap` are `@length{min:1,max:100}`, and
//! `BatchWriteItemRequestMap` and `WriteRequests` are `@length{min:1,max:25}`.
//!
//! WHICH SPELLING the member is named by is a property of the OPERATION, not of the
//! member: `BatchGetItem` names its `RequestItems` map by the wire spelling and
//! `BatchWriteItem` names the map of the same name by the lowerCamel path the request
//! validator builds, so both are pinned here side by side (see "Which form a constraint
//! clause takes" in `src/service.rs`).
