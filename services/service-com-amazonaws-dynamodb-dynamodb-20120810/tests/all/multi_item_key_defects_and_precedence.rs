//! How the BATCHED and TRANSACTIONAL write surfaces refuse a key defect, how an UPDATE's
//! empty secondary-index key is worded, which defects of a transaction are that element's
//! cancellation, and the order several defects of one request are reported in.
//!
//! Every suite here is a TABLE spanning what its rule generalises over rather than one
//! recorded request, and every assertion names its case and the value it actually read.
//!
//! RULE 1 — in the BATCHED write surface, an item whose key does not match the table's
//! `KeySchema` — a key attribute the item omits, or one carrying another type than the
//! table's `AttributeDefinitions` declare for it — is refused with the ONE fixed key-schema
//! sentence, naming no attribute and neither type, whichever of the two defects it was. The
//! `Key`-shaped members of every surface state that same sentence. The TRANSACTIONAL
//! surface states the defect instead: a key attribute of another type is reported as the
//! mismatch between the declared and the supplied type, naming the attribute, inside that
//! element's cancellation reason, while a key attribute the item omits is the fixed
//! sentence. The single-item `PutItem` states its own per-defect wording, which is a
//! different member's rule. The rows span the defect, the key's role in the schema, the
//! supplied type and the surface.
//!
//! WHICH ANSWER states that sentence inside a transaction follows the side that decided
//! it: a key the TABLE's key schema does not admit — a type it does not declare for that
//! attribute, a value past the size limit of the role it gives it — cancels the element
//! (RULE 3), while a member that is not shaped like a key at all — a key attribute the
//! element supplied no value for, an empty key value — is the request's own defect and
//! refuses the call.
//!
//! RULE 2 — an empty `S`/`B` value in a secondary index key is refused either way, and the
//! sentence depends on HOW it arrived: an item a write carried names the index and the
//! index key, while an UPDATE that would leave one empty names the update as what
//! attempted the unsupported change and names neither the index nor the key. The rows span
//! the index's kind, the attribute's role in its key schema, the value type, the spelling
//! of the update (`UpdateExpression` and the legacy `AttributeUpdates`) and the surface.
//!
//! RULE 3 — a defect a transaction decides about one element against the TABLE's own key
//! schema cancels the transaction and is reported as that element's cancellation reason
//! under the `ValidationError` code, with every other element reporting `None`. The rows
//! span the key attribute's role, the position of the offending element, the number of
//! elements and the action that writes it.
//!
//! RULE 4 — a constraint clause about a member of ONE element of a transaction names that
//! member's FULL path: the list, the element's 1-based position in it, the collection step,
//! the action the element states and the leaf member. The rows span the position, the
//! action, and the constraint the name broke.
//!
//! RULE 5 — every fact of the request is settled BEFORE any table is looked up, so a
//! malformed request naming a table that is not there is refused as the malformed request
//! it is; and a violated idempotency token is stated ALONE, masking the other violations of
//! the same request. The rows span the operation, the defect, and whether the table exists.
