//! @op BatchWriteItem
//! IMPLEMENTED: applies every `PutRequest` and `DeleteRequest` in `RequestItems` to the
//! stored tables, so a put REPLACES whatever its key held and a delete REMOVES it — "if
//! you perform a BatchWriteItem operation on an existing item, that item's values will be
//! overwritten". Each operation lands through the same store write sites `PutItem` and
//! `DeleteItem` use ([`crate::state::ComAmazonawsDynamodbDynamodb20120810State::put_item`]
//! and `delete_item`), so numbers are canonicalized exactly as they are on the
//! single-item path, each write is charged the capacity it consumed from the same
//! per-table budget, and so is the record each change publishes on its table's stream
//! ([`crate::state::publish_item_changes`]). What this path does NOT share with the
//! single-item one is the admission decision for a write the budget is short of: a
//! single-item write has nowhere to report a request it did not apply, so it is refused,
//! while a batch reports it in `UnprocessedItems` — see the admission paragraph below.
//!
//! The whole request is resolved and validated BEFORE any item lands — the tables, the key
//! schema, every value's own rules, the documented item size and the index key limits — so
//! a refused batch writes nothing. An unknown, or not yet `ACTIVE`, table is
//! `ResourceNotFoundException`; a table whose resource-based policy denies the caller
//! `dynamodb:BatchWriteItem` is `AccessDeniedException`.
//!
//! "You can only request one of these operations, not both, in a single WriteRequest" (the
//! `WriteRequest` doc), and "you cannot put and delete the same item in the same
//! BatchWriteItem request" (this operation's own doc): a `WriteRequest` carrying neither or
//! both, a batch past the documented 25 operations, and a key addressed twice are each a
//! `ValidationException`. No condition is read and no item is echoed, because
//! "you cannot specify conditions on individual put and delete requests, and BatchWriteItem
//! does not return deleted items in the response".
//!
//! Each operation is then ADMITTED on its own against the write capacity its table is
//! provisioned for and against the per-partition-key ceiling beneath it
//! ([`crate::state::Table::admit_item_write`]): one the throughput component does not
//! admit is handed back in `UnprocessedItems`, in the form it was sent, and stores
//! nothing — so a hot partition key is throttled while the same rate spread over many
//! keys is served. How much capacity a table has left decides HOW MANY of a batch's
//! requests land, not WHETHER the call gets anything done: while nothing has landed, the
//! request in hand may be served from capacity BORROWED against the budget's own refill,
//! and once something has landed the internal per-partition-key ceiling may still lend
//! ([`crate::state::Table::admit_item_write_with_progress`]), so a batch of small writes
//! aimed at one partition key lands whole with an empty `UnprocessedItems` and every call
//! answers at once with a residue its caller can resend, so the documented drain loop
//! converges.
//! Borrowed units are charged in full and repay at the provisioned rate, and the
//! borrowing is bounded, so a caller that keeps writing past what its table is
//! provisioned for runs that allowance out: from then on a batch of writes the budget
//! cannot cover gets nothing done and is refused with
//! `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException`, as is one none of whose requests the
//! ceilings could ever cover. The refusal carries the
//! `ThrottlingReasons` entry for the ceiling that bound and the ARN of the table it
//! bound on. `ReturnConsumedCapacity`
//! reports one `ConsumedCapacity` per table written and `ReturnItemCollectionMetrics=SIZE`
//! one `ItemCollectionMetrics` list per table, both totalled from stored state by
//! [`crate::state::WriteLedger`].
//!
//! ## Shape of an operation
//!
//! Each operation is a struct that owns the shared engine and implements
//! [`smithy_server_runtime::Operation`]. The framework constructs one per service via
//! `BatchWriteItem::new(engine)` and drives it through the centralized request walk:
//! deserialize → validate → `handle` → serialize. You write ONLY the `handle` body.
//!
//! ## Reaching this service's state
//!
//! The engine is held on `self` (constructor-injected), NOT passed per request — so
//! engine access is guaranteed by the time any request runs. Reach the store through
//! [`crate::state::service_state`] and read and write it through the guard it hands back:
//!
//! ```ignore
//!     let state = crate::state::service_state(&*self.engine)
//!         .ok_or(/* a modelled server error */)?;
//!     state.lock().your_field = /* ... */;
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx` ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext`]) carries request metadata only —
//! headers, URI, method, and anything middleware placed in `ctx.parts().extensions`.
//! The engine is NOT reached through `ctx`.
//!
//! @generated by the emulator core scaffold op-stub generator.
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `BatchWriteItem`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-dynamodb-dynamodb-20120810/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-dynamodb-dynamodb-20120810.json")
//! ```
//!
//! The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. A
//! single call to BatchWriteItem can transmit up to 16MB of data over the network,
//! consisting of up to 25 item put or delete operations. While individual items can be up
//! to 400 KB once stored, it's important to note that an item's representation might be
//! greater than 400KB while being sent in DynamoDB's JSON format for the API call. For more
//! details on this distinction, see Naming Rules and Data Types. BatchWriteItem cannot
//! update items. If you perform a BatchWriteItem operation on an existing item, that item's
//! values will be overwritten by the operation and it will appear like it was updated. To
//! update items, we recommend you use the UpdateItem action. The individual PutItem and
//! DeleteItem operations specified in BatchWriteItem are atomic; however BatchWriteItem as
//! a whole is not. If any requested operations fail because the table's provisioned
//! throughput is exceeded or an internal processing failure occurs, the failed operations
//! are returned in the UnprocessedItems response parameter. You can investigate and
//! optionally resend the requests. Typically, you would call BatchWriteItem in a loop. Each
//! iteration would check for unprocessed items and submit a new BatchWriteItem request with
//! those unprocessed items until all items have been processed. If BatchWriteItem cannot
//! process any items due to throttling (for example, insufficient provisioned throughput on
//! the tables in the request, or partition-level or account-level limits), it returns a
//! ProvisionedThroughputExceededException or a ThrottlingException. Both indicate that the
//! request was throttled; check the ThrottlingReason field in the returned exception for
//! details. If DynamoDB returns any unprocessed items, you should retry the batch operation
//! on those items. However, we strongly recommend that you use an exponential backoff
//! algorithm. If you retry the batch operation immediately, the underlying read or write
//! requests can still fail due to throttling on the individual tables. If you delay the
//! batch operation using exponential backoff, the individual requests in the batch are much
//! more likely to succeed. For more information, see Batch Operations and Error Handling in
//! the Amazon DynamoDB Developer Guide. With BatchWriteItem, you can efficiently write or
//! delete large amounts of data, such as from Amazon EMR, or copy data from another
//! database into DynamoDB. In order to improve performance with these large-scale
//! operations, BatchWriteItem does not behave in the same way as individual PutItem and
//! DeleteItem calls would. For example, you cannot specify conditions on individual put and
//! delete requests, and BatchWriteItem does not return deleted items in the response. If
//! you use a programming language that supports concurrency, you can use threads to write
//! items in parallel. Your application must include the necessary logic to manage the
//! threads. With languages that don't support threading, you must update or delete …
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `RequestItems` (BatchWriteItemRequestMap, len 1..25) **required** — A map of one or more
//!   table names or table ARNs and, for each table, a list of operations to be performed
//!   (DeleteRequest or PutRequest). Each element in the map consists of the following:
//!   DeleteRequest - Perform a DeleteItem operation on the specified item. The item to be
//!   deleted is identified by a Key subelement: Key - A map of primary key attribute values
//!   that uniquely identify the item. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute name
//!   and an attribute value. For each primary key, you must provide all of the key
//!   attributes. For example, with a simple primary key, you only need to provide a value for
//!   the partition key. For a composite primary key, you must provide values for both the …
//! * `ReturnConsumedCapacity` (ReturnConsumedCapacity, one of: INDEXES | NONE | TOTAL) —
//!   Determines the level of detail about either provisioned or on-demand throughput
//!   consumption that is returned in the response: INDEXES - The response includes the
//!   aggregate ConsumedCapacity for the operation, together with ConsumedCapacity for each
//!   table and secondary index that was accessed. Note that some operations, such as GetItem
//!   and BatchGetItem, do not access any indexes at all. In these cases, specifying INDEXES
//!   will only return ConsumedCapacity information for table(s). TOTAL - The response
//!   includes only the aggregate ConsumedCapacity for the operation. NONE - No
//!   ConsumedCapacity details are included in the response.
//! * `ReturnItemCollectionMetrics` (ReturnItemCollectionMetrics, one of: NONE | SIZE) —
//!   Determines whether item collection metrics are returned. If set to SIZE, the response
//!   includes statistics about item collections, if any, that were modified during the
//!   operation are returned in the response. If set to NONE (the default), no statistics are
//!   returned.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `ConsumedCapacity` (ConsumedCapacityMultiple) — The capacity units consumed by the
//!   entire BatchWriteItem operation. Each element consists of: TableName - The table that
//!   consumed the provisioned throughput. CapacityUnits - The total number of capacity units
//!   consumed. If the table has vector indexes, each element also includes a VectorIndexes
//!   field with VectorWriteRequestBytes consumed for each affected vector index.
//! * `ItemCollectionMetrics` (ItemCollectionMetricsPerTable) — A list of tables that were
//!   processed by BatchWriteItem and, for each table, information about any item collections
//!   that were affected by individual DeleteItem or PutItem operations. Each entry consists
//!   of the following subelements: ItemCollectionKey - The partition key value of the item
//!   collection. This is the same as the partition key value of the item. SizeEstimateRangeGB
//!   - An estimate of item collection size, expressed in GB. This is a two-element array
//!   containing a lower bound and an upper bound for the estimate. The estimate includes the
//!   size of all the items in the table, plus the size of all attributes projected into all
//!   of the local secondary indexes on the table. Use this estimate …
//! * `UnprocessedItems` (BatchWriteItemRequestMap, len 1..25) — A map of tables and requests
//!   against those tables that were not processed. The UnprocessedItems value is in the same
//!   form as RequestItems, so you can provide this value directly to a subsequent
//!   BatchWriteItem operation. For more information, see RequestItems in the Request
//!   Parameters section. Each UnprocessedItems entry consists of a table name or table ARN
//!   and, for that table, a list of operations to perform (DeleteRequest or PutRequest).
//!   DeleteRequest - Perform a DeleteItem operation on the specified item. The item to be
//!   deleted is identified by a Key subelement: Key - A map of primary key attribute values
//!   that uniquely identify the item. Each entry in this map consists of an attribute …
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `InternalServerError` (HTTP 500) — An error occurred on the server side.
//! * `InvalidEndpointException` (HTTP 421)
//! * `ItemCollectionSizeLimitExceededException` (HTTP 400) — An item collection is too large.
//!   This exception is only returned for tables that have one or more local secondary
//!   indexes.
//! * `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` (HTTP 400) — The request was denied due to
//!   request throttling. For detailed information about why the request was throttled and the
//!   ARN of the impacted resource, find the ThrottlingReason field in the returned exception.
//!   The Amazon Web Services SDKs for DynamoDB automatically retry requests that receive this
//!   exception. Your request is eventually successful, unless your retry queue is too large
//!   to finish. Reduce the frequency of requests and use exponential backoff. For more
//!   information, go to Error Retries and Exponential Backoff in the Amazon DynamoDB
//!   Developer Guide.
//! * `ReplicatedWriteConflictException` (HTTP 400) — The request was rejected because one or
//!   more items in the request are being modified by a request in another Region.
//! * `RequestLimitExceeded` (HTTP 400) — Throughput exceeds the current throughput quota for
//!   your account. For detailed information about why the request was throttled and the ARN
//!   of the impacted resource, find the ThrottlingReason field in the returned exception.
//!   Contact Amazon Web Services Support to request a quota increase.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 400) — The operation tried to access a nonexistent
//!   table or index. The resource might not be specified correctly, or its status might not
//!   be ACTIVE.
//! * `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 400) — The request was denied due to request throttling. For
//!   detailed information about why the request was throttled and the ARN of the impacted
//!   resource, find the ThrottlingReason field in the returned exception.
