//! What a read of a table — or of one of its secondary indexes — evaluates and reports.
//!
//! `Query` and `Scan` differ in WHICH entries they walk: a query reads one partition of
//! the schema it was pointed at, a scan reads every entry of it. Everything else about
//! being pointed at an index is the same for both, and is decided here: which index an
//! `IndexName` resolves to and the two refusals that resolution carries, what each
//! reported item is narrowed to ([`Selection`]), whether a read has to go on to the
//! parent table for an attribute its index does not project, and what one row of a page
//! was SEEN as ([`Read`]).
//!
//! A file of its own beside the item store rather than inside it: this is about what
//! one REQUEST reads and reports, not about what the store holds. It is re-exported up
//! to `crate::state`, so every caller names it `crate::state::…`.
