//! `AWS::SQS::Queue`, as it lives in the Amazon SQS service's own store.
//!
//! A queue is a resource of the Amazon SQS service: `sqs:CreateQueue` creates it,
//! `sqs:GetQueueAttributes` and `sqs:ListQueues` report it, `sqs:SetQueueAttributes`
//! changes it and `sqs:DeleteQueue` removes it, and the record of it lives in that
//! service's state in the same shared engine. So this provider holds a handle to THAT
//! store and nothing of its own: a queue this emulator holds is one Cloud Control API
//! resolves, whichever API created it, and a queue Amazon SQS no longer holds is one Cloud
//! Control API reports as not found.
//!
//! Queues are held one namespace per Region ("One namespace per region" in that service's
//! own state module), so every answer here is about the Region the call was made in: a
//! reference resolves to that Region's queue of the name it carries, exactly as the owning
//! service resolves a `QueueUrl` a request supplies ([`queue_name`]).
//!
//! The resource model is the type's registry schema. Catalog source: the `AWS::SQS::Queue`
//! resource provider schema's `properties`, whose `primaryIdentifier` is
//! `/properties/QueueUrl`, whose `additionalIdentifiers` are `/properties/Arn` and
//! `/properties/QueueName` (the three references [`queue_name`] resolves), and whose
//! `readOnlyProperties` are `/properties/Arn` and `/properties/QueueUrl`:
//!
//! * `QueueName`, the queue's name, which its url and its ARN are built from;
//! * every property that IS one of the queue's own attributes, named identically on both
//!   sides (`VisibilityTimeout`, `DelaySeconds`, `MessageRetentionPeriod`, `FifoQueue`,
//!   `RedrivePolicy`, …) — which is every attribute Amazon SQS publishes as settable
//!   except the queue's `Policy`, because this type's schema declares no such property: a
//!   queue's access policy is carried by resource types of its own
//!   (`AWS::SQS::QueuePolicy`, `AWS::SQS::QueueInlinePolicy`);
//! * `Tags`, the queue's cost allocation tags, as a list of `{ Key, Value }` pairs;
//! * the read-only `Arn` and `QueueUrl`.
//!
//! A property is carried in the form the schema declares — a count as a number, a flag as
//! a boolean, a redrive document as an object — while an attribute VALUE is text on the
//! owning service's wire, so the two are converted by that service's own spelling of the
//! rule ([`property_value`] one way, [`sqs::attribute_text`] the other) and every rule about
//! what an attribute accepts stays that service's own ([`DesiredModel::attributes`]).
//!
//! An attribute of the queue this type's schema does NOT declare is none of this type's
//! business either way: a read does not report it, and a write of this type leaves it
//! exactly as the owning store holds it.
