//! `AWS::Logs::LogGroup`, as it lives in the CloudWatch Logs service's own store.
//!
//! A log group is a resource of the CloudWatch Logs service: `logs:CreateLogGroup` creates
//! it, `logs:DescribeLogGroups` reports it and `logs:DeleteLogGroup` removes it, and the
//! record of it lives in that service's state in the same shared engine. So this provider
//! holds a handle to THAT store and nothing of its own: a group this emulator holds is one
//! Cloud Control API resolves, whichever API created it, and a group CloudWatch Logs no
//! longer holds is one Cloud Control API reports as not found.
//!
//! The resource model is the type's registry schema. Catalog source: the
//! `AWS::Logs::LogGroup` resource provider schema's `properties` — `LogGroupName`,
//! `Tags`, `RetentionInDays`, `LogGroupClass` and the read-only `Arn`, each carried by the
//! owning record and each applied here.
//!
//! The schema's remaining properties are ones THIS path cannot apply, so a model that asks
//! for one is refused rather than accepted and dropped — a property a caller sets has to be
//! one a later read reports:
//!
//! * `KmsKeyId`, because whether a key may encrypt a group is the KEY's policy's answer and
//!   lives in KMS, which the owning service asks on its own create
//!   (`logs::kms_key_grant::refusal_for`) and this path, applying the work the clock owes
//!   under the store's guard, cannot;
//! * `DataProtectionPolicy` and `FieldIndexPolicies`, because the owning service keeps each
//!   as a document of its own that a call of its own installs (`PutDataProtectionPolicy`,
//!   `PutIndexPolicy`) rather than as a field of the group's record.
//!
//! A model may still CARRY any of them with the value the group already holds — every read
//! reports them, so a model a client round-trips carries them — which is what lets an
//! update patch something else on a group that has one.
