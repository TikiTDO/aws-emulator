//! @op CreateAddon
//!
//! IMPLEMENTED. `CreateAddon` installs one add-on ON an existing cluster: it mints a
//! [`crate::state::AddonRecord`] in the shared engine's store, keyed by the cluster's
//! own `(region, name)` key plus the add-on name, and answers with the `Addon` it just
//! wrote. `DescribeAddon` reads that same record back.
//!
//! An add-on is a child of a cluster, so the layers this handler checks run from the
//! OUTSIDE IN, and each layer's refusal is the modelled error for what it found:
//!
//! 1. the cluster named by the `@httpLabel` must exist IN THE REQUEST'S REGION —
//!    otherwise `ResourceNotFoundException` (404), before any member of the body is
//!    looked at, because a request against a cluster that does not exist cannot be
//!    answered whatever else it says;
//! 2. that cluster must have an Amazon EKS-managed control plane for an add-on to
//!    live in — otherwise the connected-cluster refusal, which no wait can change;
//! 3. the body's own members must hold up — otherwise `InvalidParameterException`
//!    (400), naming the member and what it must be. The add-on and the build asked
//!    for are held to the CATALOG the same `DescribeAddonVersions` serves: a name
//!    the catalog publishes no build of for the cluster's Kubernetes version, and a
//!    build whose compatibilities do not carry that version, are both refused, and
//!    the `configurationValues` document is read and held to the schema
//!    `DescribeAddonConfiguration` publishes for that build. What the request ASKS
//!    FOR does not depend on what the cluster is doing, so this layer runs BEFORE
//!    the one below: a caller debugging its request is told what is wrong with it
//!    rather than what the cluster is busy with;
//! 4. that cluster must be `ACTIVE` — otherwise `InvalidRequestException` (400), the
//!    modelled error for "the request is invalid given the state of the cluster";
//! 5. the add-on must not already be installed — otherwise `ResourceInUseException`
//!    (409), unless the request replays the `clientRequestToken` that created it, in
//!    which case that add-on is returned again. This layer runs BEFORE the checks on
//!    the child resources the add-on would create, so a retry of a call that already
//!    succeeded is absorbed rather than colliding with its own children;
//! 6. the EKS Pod Identity associations the add-on would create must fit the
//!    cluster's association ceiling and must not double-book a `(namespace, service
//!    account)` pair — otherwise `InvalidRequestException` (400) or
//!    `ResourceInUseException` (409), decided before anything is written, so a
//!    request that cannot be carried out in full writes nothing.
//!
//! What a refusal's PAYLOAD reports beside the sentence is a rule of its own: a
//! refusal about the add-on the request names, or about the cluster, reports them in
//! the exception's `addonName`/`clusterName`, while one about the request's own text
//! carries the sentence alone — see the two refusal shapes the handler builds.
//!
//! The record carries both the caller's input and the server-generated parts
//! (`addonArn`, `createdAt`, `modifiedAt`, the assigned version, the namespace the
//! add-on went into, the ARNs of the EKS Pod Identity associations it owns), so a
//! later read returns exactly these bytes rather than recomputing them.
//!
//! An add-on asked for `podIdentityAssociations` CREATES those associations: one
//! [`crate::state::PodIdentityAssociationRecord`] per entry, minted through the same
//! path `CreatePodIdentityAssociation` uses and carrying this add-on's ARN as its
//! `ownerArn`, so `DescribePodIdentityAssociation` and `ListPodIdentityAssociations`
//! find exactly the associations the add-on reports.
//!
//! A new add-on is reported `CREATING` and the clock owes it the TERMINAL state its
//! install settles in [`crate::state::ADDON_ACTIVATION_DELAY`] later: an install is
//! asynchronous and settles in the state that reflects what the cluster could do with
//! it — running, running without the replica it needs, or failed because the
//! Kubernetes resources it is applied against are not there or refused it
//! ([`crate::state::ComAmazonawsEksAwswesleyfrontendState::addon_install_outcome`]).
//! Both the outcome and the due instant are stored on the record and materialised by
//! whichever read first runs after it.
//!
//! An install the service never STARTS is the exception, and it is the same decision
//! made at the same point: where the unmet precondition is the ADD-ON's own rather
//! than the cluster's — the AWS Marketplace subscription its software cannot be
//! pulled without — nothing is applied, so no later instant can change the answer and
//! there is no `CREATING` to report. Such a request is still ACCEPTED: the add-on is
//! created in the terminal state it is already in, carrying the health issue that
//! says what is missing, which is what a client reads off it and remediates
//! ([`crate::state::AddonInstallOutcome::refused`]).
//!
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.

//! Creates an Amazon EKS add-on. Amazon EKS add-ons help to automate the provisioning and
//! lifecycle management of common operational software for Amazon EKS clusters. For more
//! information, see Amazon EKS add-ons in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `addonName` (String) **required** — The name of the add-on. The name must match one of
//!   the names returned by DescribeAddonVersions.
//! * `addonVersion` (String) — The version of the add-on. The version must match one of the
//!   versions returned by DescribeAddonVersions .
//! * `clientRequestToken` (String, @idempotencyToken) — A unique, case-sensitive identifier
//!   that you provide to ensure the idempotency of the request.
//! * `clusterName` (ClusterName, len 1..100, pattern ^[0-9A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\-_]*$)
//!   **required** — The name of your cluster.
//! * `configurationValues` (String) — The set of configuration values for the add-on that's
//!   created. The values that you provide are validated against the schema returned by
//!   DescribeAddonConfiguration.
//! * `namespaceConfig` (AddonNamespaceConfigRequest) — The namespace configuration for the
//!   addon. If specified, this will override the default namespace for the addon.
//! * `podIdentityAssociations` (AddonPodIdentityAssociationsList) — An array of EKS Pod
//!   Identity associations to be created. Each association maps a Kubernetes service account
//!   to an IAM role. For more information, see Attach an IAM Role to an Amazon EKS add-on
//!   using EKS Pod Identity in the Amazon EKS User Guide.
//! * `resolveConflicts` (ResolveConflicts, one of: NONE | OVERWRITE | PRESERVE) — How to
//!   resolve field value conflicts for an Amazon EKS add-on. Conflicts are handled based on
//!   the value you choose: None – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on
//!   your cluster, Amazon EKS doesn't change the value. Creation of the add-on might fail.
//!   Overwrite – If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster and
//!   the Amazon EKS default value is different than the existing value, Amazon EKS changes
//!   the value to the Amazon EKS default value. Preserve – This is similar to the NONE
//!   option. If the self-managed version of the add-on is installed on your cluster Amazon
//!   EKS doesn't change the add-on resource properties. Creation of the add-on might fail if
//!   …
//! * `serviceAccountRoleArn` (RoleArn, len 1..255) — The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an
//!   existing IAM role to bind to the add-on's service account. The role must be assigned the
//!   IAM permissions required by the add-on. If you don't specify an existing IAM role, then
//!   the add-on uses the permissions assigned to the node IAM role. For more information, see
//!   Amazon EKS node IAM role in the Amazon EKS User Guide. To specify an existing IAM role,
//!   you must have an IAM OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider created for your cluster. For more
//!   information, see Enabling IAM roles for service accounts on your cluster in the Amazon
//!   EKS User Guide.
//! * `tags` (TagMap, len 1..50) — Metadata that assists with categorization and organization.
//!   Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. You define both. Tags don't propagate
//!   to any other cluster or Amazon Web Services resources.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `addon` (Addon) — An Amazon EKS add-on. For more information, see Amazon EKS add-ons in
//!   the Amazon EKS User Guide.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ClientException` (HTTP 400) — These errors are usually caused by a client action.
//!   Actions can include using an action or resource on behalf of an IAM principal that
//!   doesn't have permissions to use the action or resource or specifying an identifier that
//!   is not valid.
//! * `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400) — The specified parameter is invalid. Review the
//!   available parameters for the API request.
//! * `InvalidRequestException` (HTTP 400) — The request is invalid given the state of the
//!   cluster. Check the state of the cluster and the associated operations.
//! * `ResourceInUseException` (HTTP 409) — The specified resource is in use.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — The specified resource could not be found. You
//!   can view your available clusters with ListClusters. You can view your available managed
//!   node groups with ListNodegroups. Amazon EKS clusters and node groups are Amazon Web
//!   Services Region specific.
//! * `ServerException` (HTTP 500) — These errors are usually caused by a server-side issue.
