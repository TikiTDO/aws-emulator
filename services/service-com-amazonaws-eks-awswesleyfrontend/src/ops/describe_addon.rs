//! @op DescribeAddon
//!
//! IMPLEMENTED. `DescribeAddon` REPORTS the [`crate::state::AddonRecord`] that
//! `CreateAddon` wrote; it is the read-back for that slice and writes nothing of its
//! own beyond materialising the status move the clock already owed
//! ([`crate::state::AddonRecord::materialize_due_transitions`]), which was due whether
//! or not anybody called.
//!
//! The layers are the same as `CreateAddon`'s, outside in: the cluster named by the
//! `@httpLabel` must exist in the request's region, and then the add-on must be
//! installed on it — each missing resource is the modelled `ResourceNotFoundException`
//! (404), naming which one was not found.
//!
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.
//!
//! ---
//!
//! # Modeled contract for `DescribeAddon`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-eks-awswesleyfrontend/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-eks-awswesleyfrontend.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Describes an Amazon EKS add-on.
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `addonName` (String) **required** — The name of the add-on. The name must match one of
//!   the names returned by ListAddons .
//! * `clusterName` (ClusterName, len 1..100, pattern ^[0-9A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9\-_]*$)
//!   **required** — The name of your cluster.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `addon` (Addon) — An Amazon EKS add-on. For more information, see Amazon EKS add-ons in
//!   the Amazon EKS User Guide.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `ClientException` (HTTP 400) — These errors are usually caused by a client action.
//!   Actions can include using an action or resource on behalf of an IAM principal that
//!   doesn't have permissions to use the action or resource or specifying an identifier that
//!   is not valid.
//! * `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400) — The specified parameter is invalid. Review the
//!   available parameters for the API request.
//! * `InvalidRequestException` (HTTP 400) — The request is invalid given the state of the
//!   cluster. Check the state of the cluster and the associated operations.
//! * `ResourceNotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — The specified resource could not be found. You
//!   can view your available clusters with ListClusters. You can view your available managed
//!   node groups with ListNodegroups. Amazon EKS clusters and node groups are Amazon Web
//!   Services Region specific.
//! * `ServerException` (HTTP 500) — These errors are usually caused by a server-side issue.
