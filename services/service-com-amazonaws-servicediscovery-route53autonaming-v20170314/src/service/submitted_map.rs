//! The ORDER this service states a map member's entries in inside a constraint clause.
//!
//! A clause about a map member quotes the map the request submitted
//! (`{<key>=<value>, …}`, the shared rendering in
//! `service_common::submitted_collections`), and the entries are stated in neither the
//! order the request wrote them nor the order of the keys: the validation layer in front of
//! the service iterates the map it built from the request, and that iteration is a HASH
//! TABLE walk — the entries come out bucket by bucket. The order is therefore a function of
//! the KEYS and the entry COUNT, deterministic for one request and the same on every run,
//! which is why it can be reproduced here rather than being a value one recording happened
//! to carry.
//!
//! # What pins the order
//!
//! The recorded response this order is read off is the `UpdateServiceAttributes` step of
//! the `servicediscovery-service-attributes-crud-and-limits` trace, which submits a map of
//! 35 attributes keyed `key0`..`key34` and is answered with a clause quoting them in the
//! sequence `key1, key2, key0, key5, key6, key3, key4, key9, key7, key8, key22, key21,
//! key20, key15, key14, key13, key12, key34, …` — neither the submitted order nor the key
//! order, and exactly the bucket order the rule below produces for those keys over a
//! 64-bucket table. A future reader checking this module should re-check THAT premise
//! against a recording, not only the arithmetic: the restated order always replaces the
//! shared walk's key order, so a wrong premise would reorder every such clause.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Three facts fix the order:
//!
//! * the key's 32-bit string hash — `h = 31 * h + c` over the key's UTF-16 code units, in
//!   wrapping arithmetic ([`string_hash`]);
//! * the bucket that hash lands in — the hash mixed with its own high half and masked to
//!   the table's size ([`bucket_of`]), over a table that starts at [`INITIAL_CAPACITY`] and
//!   doubles while the entries would pass the
//!   [`LOAD_FACTOR_NUMERATOR`]/[`LOAD_FACTOR_DENOMINATOR`] load ([`capacity_for`]);
//! * and, for two keys that share a bucket, the order they were PUT in, which is the order
//!   the request's JSON object wrote them — so the ordering is a STABLE sort of the
//!   submitted entries by bucket ([`in_iteration_order`]).
//!
//! One case is NOT modelled: a single bucket holding [`TREEIFIED_BUCKET`] entries or more,
//! which the iteration re-orders by a rule of its own. The load the table is kept under
//! puts that far outside any map this model declares (the longest is 30 entries over a
//! 64-bucket table), and such a map is declined here rather than stated in an order this
//! layer is not sure of — the shared layer then keeps the framework's own summary of the
//! collection, which is the fail-safe direction.
