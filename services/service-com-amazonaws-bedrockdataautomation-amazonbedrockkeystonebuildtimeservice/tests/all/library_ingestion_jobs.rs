//! End-to-end HTTP coverage of the data automation library INGESTION JOB:
//! `InvokeDataAutomationLibraryIngestionJob` mints one,
//! `GetDataAutomationLibraryIngestionJob` reports it and
//! `ListDataAutomationLibraryIngestionJobs` enumerates the jobs of one library.
//!
//! Every case drives the real `restJson1` wire path — `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` with
//! a signed-looking request — so routing, HTTP binding, constraint validation, the handler
//! and response serialization are all exercised, exactly as an AWS SDK
//! `bedrock-data-automation` client would.
//!
//! RULE. An ingestion job is a resource OF the one library its `libraryArn` names: a
//! submission mints it under that library and answers its `jobArn`, a read of the
//! (library, job) pair reports it, and the library's listing enumerates exactly the jobs
//! minted under it — in this service's listing order (`creationTime`, then ARN), one page
//! at a time, with `maxResults` capping the page and a `nextToken` handed back only while
//! something is left after it. Each item carries what the modelled
//! `DataAutomationLibraryIngestionJobSummary` declares
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape",shape="DataAutomationLibraryIngestionJobSummary")`:
//! `jobArn`, `jobStatus`, `entityType`, `operationType`, `creationTime`,
//! `completionTime`), read back out of the record the submission persisted. A library this
//! store holds nothing under resolves to nothing, so every one of the three refuses it.
//!
//! The suites are TABLE-driven: the rows differ along the number of jobs stored, the page
//! size asked for, which library is addressed, the entity and operation types submitted
//! and the input source named — never over one recorded request.
