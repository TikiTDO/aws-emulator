//! What a LOGGING trail delivers for the account's DATA events — the calls on the CONTENTS
//! of a resource, as against the control-plane calls the neighbouring suites cover.
//!
//! Three services are mounted on ONE engine, because the behaviour spans them: CloudTrail
//! holds the trail and decides the delivery, Amazon Cognito Identity serves the identity
//! data plane, and the object store is where the log files land. Every call goes over the
//! wire the way a client makes it — the data-plane calls UNSIGNED, which is how an end user
//! holding no AWS credential makes them — and the bucket is created, policied, listed and
//! read through Amazon S3's OWN API over the same in-process callback a handler uses, so a
//! delivered log file counts only if the object store itself answers with it.
//!
//! The rule under test: while a trail is logging, every served call an ADVANCED event
//! selector of that trail admits is delivered into the trail's bucket under the documented
//! key layout — a DATA event included, which such a selector admits by naming the `Data`
//! category and the TYPE of the resource the call acted on. Each delivered record carries
//! the serving service as its `eventSource`, the operation as its `eventName`,
//! `eventCategory` `Data` with `managementEvent` false, the resource it acted on by type and
//! ARN, the id the CALLER was answered under as its `requestID`, the redaction literal in
//! place of every secret the call carried, and the identity the request was signed with — or
//! the unknown principal, for a request that carried no credential at all. A data event is
//! NOT event history: `LookupEvents` reports none of them.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over rather than the one call that motivated it:
//! which data-plane operation served the call, whether the call was served or refused,
//! whether it was signed or anonymous, and — in the second case — which selectors a trail
//! carries, since a trail delivers a data event only while one of its selectors admits it.
