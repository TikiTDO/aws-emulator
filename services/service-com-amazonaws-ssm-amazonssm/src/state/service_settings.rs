//! The account's SERVICE SETTINGS: the account-level settings the Systems Manager
//! service teams provision, which `GetServiceSetting` reports, `UpdateServiceSetting`
//! overwrites and `ResetServiceSetting` restores to the provisioned value.
//!
//! "Services map a SettingId object to a setting value. Amazon Web Services services
//! teams define the default value for a SettingId. You can't create a new SettingId, but
//! you can overwrite the default value" — so the set of settings an account holds is a
//! CATALOGUE ([`SETTINGS`]) rather than something a caller creates, and a `SettingId`
//! outside it is reported as a setting no service team has provisioned. Each entry
//! carries the value the service team provisioned and, where the API documents them, the
//! values that setting accepts ([`SettingDefinition`]).
//!
//! Only a setting an account has MODIFIED is stored ([`ServiceSettingRecord`]): a setting
//! nobody has touched is reported from the catalogue, at the provisioned value and the
//! `Default` status, and the modification that an update or a reset makes is what puts a
//! record in the store. A reset is therefore a modification too — it records who restored
//! the provisioned value and when — rather than the erasure of one, so no reader sees a
//! setting's `LastModifiedDate` move backwards.
//!
//! A setting is reached through one Region's endpoint and its ARN names that Region
//! ([`ServiceSettingRecord::to_service_setting`]), so the store is keyed by
//! `(region, setting id)` the way the rest of this service's state is.
//!
//! What a setting's value makes other operations DO is each of those operations' own
//! behaviour: this slice records the account's choice and reports it, and nothing here
//! changes what a parameter write or a node activation does.
