//! Listing the SSM documents an account holds in a Region: which documents a listing
//! walks, the filters that narrow it, and the identity each one is reported by.
//!
//! A listing reports the documents reachable through the Region's endpoint — the ones a
//! caller created there AND the ones Systems Manager publishes in every account
//! ([`super::PUBLISHED_DOCUMENTS`]) — so every name a read resolves
//! ([`ComAmazonawsSsmAmazonssmState::resolve_document`]) is a name the listing walks, and
//! nothing appears that no read can resolve. The walk is in ascending name order, which
//! is what makes a page's resume cursor total: the cursor is the NAME the next page starts
//! at, not an offset into a list that may have changed between two pages.
//!
//! Each document is reported ONCE, by the identity of its DEFAULT version — the version a
//! read that names no selector resolves to ([`super::DocumentRecord::select`]) — and
//! everything that identity carries beyond the whole document's name, owner, type and
//! tags comes from that version ([`document_identifier`]).
//!
//! A filter narrows the walk by one attribute of a document
//! ([`DocumentListingFilter::matches`]). Filters are ANDed and the values of one filter
//! ORed: "If you specify more than two keys, only documents that are identified by all the
//! tags are returned in the results. If you specify more than two values for a key,
//! documents that are identified by any of the values are returned in the results"
//! (`DocumentKeyValuesFilter`). The keys are the Amazon Web Services-provided ones that
//! same doc lists ([`DOCUMENT_KEY_VALUES_FILTER_KEYS`]) and the `tag:tagName` form; a key
//! outside them names no attribute of a document, which is what `InvalidFilterKey` ("The
//! specified key isn't valid") reports.
