//! The Docker Registry v2 data plane: the endpoint a `docker pull` (and anything built on
//! containerd) actually talks to.
//!
//! # The rule this module implements
//!
//! Amazon ECR serves the Docker Registry HTTP API V2 on the registry endpoint it publishes
//! for a registry (AWS's own `<account>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com`, and here the
//! endpoint a caller reached this emulator on, which is what `GetAuthorizationToken`
//! reports as its `proxyEndpoint`): a request to `/v2/<name>/manifests/<reference>`
//! carrying the `docker login` credential answers the manifest that repository holds for
//! the reference, and one to `/v2/<name>/blobs/<digest>` answers the blob's own bytes. That
//! endpoint is what a pull IS — the control-plane operations (`BatchGetImage`,
//! `GetDownloadUrlForLayer`) are the API spelling of the same reads — so a registry that
//! does not serve it cannot be pulled from by any Docker-compatible client.
//!
//! The path space is claimed whatever host the request arrived on, because that endpoint is
//! whichever address the client was handed: this emulator serves one registry, and the
//! repository a request names is resolved in it.
//!
//! Those paths name no modelled operation of this service (every operation is `POST /` on
//! awsJson1_1), so the same two seams carry this plane as carry the layer download plane:
//! [`Service::can_handle`](smithy_server_runtime::Service::can_handle) claims the path
//! space, and [`Service::override_routing_error`](smithy_server_runtime::Service::override_routing_error)
//! serves it — which is also BEFORE authentication, because what authorises a registry
//! request is its own Basic credential rather than a SigV4 signature.
//!
//! # What authorises one
//!
//! The credential `GetAuthorizationToken` minted, presented as HTTP Basic authorization:
//! the token decodes to `user:password` "for private registry authentication using `docker
//! login`" (`AuthorizationData$authorizationToken`), so a client sends exactly that pair.
//! The password is checked against the issues this registry recorded
//! (`crate::state::registry_v2`), so a credential this registry never minted, one it minted
//! for a window that has closed, and no credential at all each reach no repository — a
//! private registry's contents stay private, and nothing here is served anonymously.
//!
//! # What a pull changes
//!
//! A manifest GET is the pull, and ECR records two things about one: the image's
//! `lastRecordedPullTime` and the `AWS/ECR` `RepositoryPullCount` datapoint for the
//! repository (`crate::state::pull_metrics`). A `HEAD` of the same address is a client
//! checking whether the manifest is there — containerd's existence probe — and transfers no
//! image, so it records neither. A blob fetch is part of the pull the manifest already
//! counted, so it records nothing of its own.
//!
//! # Its envelope
//!
//! A registry client is not an AWS SDK client: a refusal is the registry API's own error
//! document, `{"errors":[{"code":…,"message":…}]}` with the code and status the Docker
//! Registry HTTP API V2 error-code table states for that condition, and every response
//! carries the API version header a client reads to discover that this endpoint speaks V2.
