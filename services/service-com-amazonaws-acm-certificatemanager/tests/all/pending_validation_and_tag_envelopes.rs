//! What a request WAITING for domain validation can still do, the shape of the DNS
//! challenge it waits on, and the envelopes ACM's tag APIs answer with — end to end
//! over the wire (`POST /`, `X-Amz-Target: CertificateManager.<Op>`, awsJson1_1).
//!
//! Six rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE spanning what it generalises over
//! rather than the one request that exposed it:
//!
//! 1. A public certificate request stays `PENDING_VALIDATION` while ACM waits for proof
//!    of domain control, which arrives out of band: the only outcome the clock owes it
//!    is the timeout at the end of the documented 72-hour validation window ("ACM makes
//!    repeated attempts to validate a certificate for 72 hours and then times out",
//!    `CertificateDetail$Status` doc), so everything a pending validation exists for
//!    stays reachable — the approval mail `ResendValidationEmail` resends, the CNAME
//!    `DescribeCertificate` publishes. A name whose control can never be proven,
//!    because its top-level label is one the public DNS delegates to nobody (RFC 2606
//!    §2, RFC 6761), is the exception ACM refuses up front.
//! 2. An operation that needs an ISSUED certificate and is handed one in any other
//!    status reports a PROCESSING STATE, `InvalidStateException` (HTTP 400) — a refusal
//!    the same request stops drawing once the certificate is issued.
//! 3. A DNS validation's CNAME target is a name under the validation's OWN subdomain of
//!    the ACM validation zone: `_<token>.<per-validation label>.acm-validations.<zone>.`
//!    — a token label, then a label of its own, then the zone.
//! 4. A tag listing reports the stored tag set, so a resource with no tags answers with
//!    the EMPTY list and never with the member missing.
//! 5. A request past the 50-user-tag quota is refused with the service's one constant
//!    sentence for that quota rule, whichever error shape the operation models for it,
//!    and the stored tag set is left at the quota.
//! 6. A constraint failure on the ELEMENTS of a list member is reported at that member
//!    with the WHOLE set of constraints the element shape declares, and a
//!    `ResourceNotFoundException` for a type-agnostic ARN names the resource TYPE that
//!    ARN carries.
//!
//! Every call goes through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` on the shared harness in
//! [`crate::certificate_lifecycle`], and every write is read back through the operation
//! that reports it, so nothing here can pass on a response the store does not back.
