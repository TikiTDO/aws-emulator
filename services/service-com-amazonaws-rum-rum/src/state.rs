//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-rum-rum service.
//!
//! The app monitor is this service's primary resource: `CreateAppMonitor`,
//! `GetAppMonitor`, `ListAppMonitors`, `UpdateAppMonitor`, `DeleteAppMonitor`,
//! `ListTagsForResource` and the data-plane `PutRumEvents` all read and write the ONE
//! [`AppMonitorRecord`] map held here, so every one of them answers from persisted state
//! rather than from its own request. The helpers beside the map (id minting, the derived
//! ARN and CloudWatch Logs group name, the `ResourceArn` -> monitor resolution, the
//! documented defaults, the record -> wire-shape projections and the error builders) live
//! here for the same reason: every operation file shares them, and a second copy of any
//! of them would let two operations disagree about one resource.
//!
//! The metrics side of a monitor hangs off that same record: the extended-metrics
//! destinations `PutRumMetricsDestination` creates, and under each of them the metric
//! definitions `BatchCreateRumMetricDefinitions` creates,
//! `BatchGetRumMetricDefinitions` reports, `UpdateRumMetricDefinition` replaces and
//! `BatchDeleteRumMetricDefinitions` removes. Both
//! are keyed through the one [`metric_destination_key`], so no two of those operations can
//! disagree about which destination a request names.

///   definition whose `Namespace` is omitted or `AWS/RUM` is an EXTENDED metric, so its
///   `Name` has to be one [`EXTENDED_METRIC_CATALOG`] lists and its `ValueKey` and

///   certain combinations of values for `Name`, `ValueKey`, and `EventPattern` are
///   valid"). Every other definition is a CUSTOM metric, whose namespace "can't be omitted
///   and can't be `AWS/RUM`".
/// * `EventPattern` (from the model): "The pattern that defines the metric, specified as a
///   JSON object", so a pattern that is not one defines nothing.
/// * `DimensionKeys` (from the model): "For both extended metrics and custom metrics, all
///   dimensions listed in this field must also be included in `EventPattern`" — the
///   dimension's value is read out of the matched event, so the pattern has to name that
///   field, and a definition with dimensions but no pattern names none of them. For an
///   EXTENDED metric the ENTRIES themselves are pinned too, to the pairs
///   [`EXTENDED_DIMENSION_ENTRIES`] lists ([`extended_metric_refusal`]).
/// * The event fields a CUSTOM metric reads and the pattern it reads them by (from the
///   model): every first-level key its `ValueKey`, `EventPattern` and `DimensionKeys` name
///   has to be a field a RUM event carries, a pattern filtering on `event_details` has to
///   filter on `event_type` too, and the array a first-level key of its pattern carries holds

///
/// Which DESTINATION the request names is deliberately none of them, which is why this

/// field only if you are sending the metric to CloudWatch") bounds what the dimensions DO,
/// not whether a definition may declare them: the member a read reports the stored map back

/// of `DimensionKeys` is ignored" — which is a stored definition carrying the map under
/// either destination, and the operation's own documentation has extended metrics, the
/// metrics those additional dimensions belong to, going "to both Evidently and CloudWatch".
/// `UnitLabel` is scoped the same way and reported the same way. The `Destination` pairings
