//! Paging `GetAppMonitorData` while the buffer it reads keeps changing.
//!
//! The rule under test: a page of a paginated read resumes strictly after the KEY of the
//! last entry the previous page returned — here the rank the data plane appended that event
//! at — and is answered against the query its token was issued for, so each entry matching
//! that query is reported exactly once across its pages however the collection changes in
//! between, and a token presented with another query is refused rather than read as a
//! position in it.
//!
//! Each table below differs along what that rule generalises over: the page size, how many
//! events are delivered between two pages and whether the walk is still running when they
//! arrive, how many events the buffer's ceiling evicts between two pages, which component
//! of the query a resuming request changes, and where the window's end falls among the
//! events' instants (including an event stamped AHEAD of the server clock, which
//! `RumEvent$timestamp` — "The exact time that this event occurred", a `Timestamp` with no
//! range — admits).
