//! End-to-end tests for the CONTAINERS an exported OpenAPI 3.0 document carries, in every
//! serialization the export is written in: the document's top-level Components Object, and
//! each Response Object's `content` map.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — a `restJson1` HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router into the mounted service — so what is asserted is what a client
//! sees, not what a handler returns. The emulator, the raw `GetExport` call, the YAML
//! reading of an export and the `CreateRestApi`/`CreateResource`/`PutMethod`/
//! `PutMethodResponse`/`CreateDeployment` helpers are this crate's existing harness, reused
//! from `rest_api_lifecycle`, `execute_api_data_plane`, `method_response`, `stage_export`
//! and `stage_export_content_types`.
//!
//! The rule asserted here, over a SET of inputs rather than one recorded export: a 3.0
//! document always carries the container a reader of the definition looks in — the one
//! Components Object the document's reusable definitions live in, and the `content` map a
//! Response Object states its representations in — whether or not the definition has
//! anything to put in it, in whichever serialization `accepts` selected, and what fills it
//! comes from the stored records. The sibling `stage_export_version_and_containers` suite
//! asserts the same rule on the JSON serialization and the 2.0 dialect's lack of either
//! container; what these rows add is the SERIALIZATION axis — an empty mapping is a value
//! of the document, so the YAML spelling of the export carries it too — and the rows that
//! FILL the Components Object, so a document that carries the key cannot be one that
//! hard-codes it empty.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the API declares that could fill the two containers: how
//! many method responses a method has (none, one, several), and which authorization it
//! carries (none, an API key, IAM and an API key — each naming a security scheme the
//! Components Object holds). The serializations are both values `accepts` takes plus the
//! request that sends no `Accept` header at all.
