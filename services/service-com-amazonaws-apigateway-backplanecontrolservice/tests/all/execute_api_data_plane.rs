//! End-to-end tests for the `execute-api` DATA plane: a request addressed to a deployed
//! REST API stage's invoke URL.
//!
//! Every case drives the real wire path — an HTTP request through the multi-service router
//! into the mounted service, on the api's own
//! `{rest-api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com` host — so what is asserted is what a
//! client of the published invoke URL sees, not what a handler returns. The control plane
//! is driven through the same emulator ([`Gateway`], this crate's one wire-test harness) to
//! build the records the data plane then resolves, so nothing here reaches into state.
//!
//! The tests assert RULES over sets of inputs, not one recorded call:
//!
//! * every request to a deployed stage is ANSWERED, and which status it gets is decided by
//!   the api's own records, over a table of paths (root, literal, path parameter, greedy
//!   parameter, unmatched), verbs (the method's own, the `ANY` catch-all, one not
//!   deployed), and stages (deployed, unknown) — plus the deployment-snapshot rule in both
//!   directions, by redeploying: both for the methods the deployment holds and for the
//!   CONFIGURATION of a method it holds, which an undeployed edit does not change;
//! * a `MOCK` integration's response is built from the selected integration response, over
//!   a table of status codes, response templates, negotiated content types and header
//!   mappings;
//! * the method's deployed `authorizationType` and `apiKeyRequired` decide the refusal,
//!   over a table spanning each documented authorization type and each way an API key can
//!   fail to admit a call;
//! * an integration that names a backend this emulator cannot call is answered as an
//!   integration that could not be performed, over a table of the integration types and
//!   configurations that cannot be served;
//! * a gateway-response customization of the refused type reaches the caller;
//! * `PutIntegrationResponse` round-trips through `GetIntegration`, and its refusals are
//!   the modelled ones.
