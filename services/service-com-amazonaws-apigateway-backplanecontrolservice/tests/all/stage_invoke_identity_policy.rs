//! End-to-end tests for the IDENTITY-based half of the `execute-api` data plane's
//! authorizer: what a deployed stage answers a request signed with credentials whose
//! principal is not allowed `execute-api:Invoke`.
//!
//! THE RULE UNDER TEST: a request to a method that AUTHENTICATES a caller
//! (`authorizationType` `AWS_IAM`) is served only where the identity-based policies in
//! force on the principal the presented credentials speak for — or the api's own resource
//! policy, since either grant suffices — allow `execute-api:Invoke` on the method's own ARN
//! (`arn:aws:execute-api:{region}:{account}:{api-id}/{stage}/{verb}/{path}`); every other
//! request is refused `403` with the IAM authorization sentence, `x-amzn-ErrorType:
//! AccessDeniedException`, and the integration never reached. A credential that names no
//! principal the account holds policies for is one this emulator cannot judge, and a grant
//! it cannot read grounds no refusal.
//!
//! That sentence CLOSES with the clause IAM words the reason of an authorization failure in:
//! which of the documents consulted refused the call, and whether its deny was explicit —
//! so a caller can tell a deny a grant would lift from one no grant lifts. The rows below
//! span the readings this gate reaches: no readable document allows the action, a readable
//! document denies it, and the ceiling in force on the principal does not allow what its
//! policies granted.
//!
//! WHY the session is the case that matters: an identity pool hands short-lived,
//! deliberately under-privileged credentials of its authenticated or unauthenticated role
//! to clients it does not trust, so a role carrying no `execute-api` grant must reach no
//! `AWS_IAM` method of a deployed stage. `cognito-identity:GetCredentialsForIdentity`,
//! `sts:AssumeRole` and `sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` all mint that credential as an
//! assumed-role session of the same registry, which is the one principal form the rows
//! below seed.
//!
//! The role, its policies, the session and the long-term access key live in the IAM and STS
//! stores of the SAME shared engine — the stores those services' own handlers write — so
//! the documents under test are the ones `iam:PutRolePolicy` stores and the principal a
//! refusal blames is the one `sts:GetCallerIdentity` answers for the key the request signed
//! with. Everything about the api is written through this service's control plane
//! (`CreateRestApi`, `CreateResource`, `PutMethod`, `PutIntegration`, `CreateDeployment`,
//! `UpdateRestApi`) and every case drives the real wire path — an HTTP request through the
//! multi-service router to the api's own invoke host — so what is asserted is what a client
//! holding those credentials sees.
//!
//! The tables span what the rule generalises over: the document in force on the caller
//! (none at all, the exact action on the exact method, the action in another case, every
//! action of the service, another service's action, a grant scoped to another stage, verb
//! or path, a wildcard over the api's methods, an explicit deny beside a grant of
//! everything), the PRINCIPAL the credential speaks for (an assumed-role session, an IAM
//! user's long-term key, the account's own published credential), the api's own resource
//! policy beside the caller's policies (both directions of "either grant suffices"), and
//! the method's own `authorizationType` (`AWS_IAM`, which authenticates a caller, and
//! `NONE`, which authenticates nobody and so reads no identity policy at all).
//!
//! The gate under test is `src/service/invoke/execute_api_authorization.rs`, whose own unit
//! tests pin how the two grants combine over a table of documents, and which
//! `core/router/tests/all/apigateway_iam_authorized_invoke.rs` drives through the real vend
//! across four services. What is added here is the END-TO-END reading of it inside THIS
//! crate, over the rows that suite does not carry: the action in another case, a grant scoped
//! to another stage, verb or path, an IAM user's long-term key, the api's own resource policy
//! in both directions, and a method that authenticates nobody.
