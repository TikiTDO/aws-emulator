//! @op UpdateStage
//! IMPLEMENTED: applies the request's `patchOperations` to the stored `Stage` record of
//! `restApiId`/`stageName`, in request order, and reports the updated stage — so a later
//! `GetStage` reads back exactly what the patch set.
//!
//! The whole list is applied to a COPY of the record and written back only once every op
//! has succeeded, so a list carrying one unsupported op leaves the stored stage as it was
//! rather than half-patched.
//!
//! Enabling, resizing or disabling the stage's cache cluster is a transition the CLOCK
//! owes: the due instant is stored on the record (see [`crate::state::StageEntry`]) and
//! `cacheClusterStatus` is computed from it, so a caller reading straight after this call
//! still observes `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` or `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS`.
//!
//! Turning a method's EXECUTION logging on is gated on the account rather than on the
//! stage: API Gateway writes those log events under the account-level CloudWatch Logs
//! role, so a patch that sets a logging level other than off, or turns the full
//! request/response data trace on, is refused while the account singleton carries no role
//! — see [`ACCOUNT_CLOUDWATCH_ROLE_REQUIRED`].
//!
//! What an `op` means, how a `path` is read and how a single-valued member, a map
//! member or a bounded number is edited are the service's shared patch semantics
//! (`crate::state`'s patch section); this file only maps each supported path to the
//! member of a stage it names.
//!
//! Two paths of this surface are not a plain member of the `Stage` shape:
//!
//! * the per-method settings. A method-setting path is the TWO reference tokens naming
//!   the method followed by the setting it writes (`/~1pets/GET/metrics/enabled`), the
//!   key being `{resource-path}/{HTTP-METHOD}` or `*/*` as `Stage$methodSettings`
//!   documents — so a `/` inside the resource path is escaped `~1` in the PATH while the
//!   separator before the HTTP method is a real one, the KEY carries the method path
//!   unescaped, and a pointer that escapes that separator too names no method at all — see
//!   [`apply_method_setting_patch`], [`METHOD_PATH_TOKENS`] and [`method_settings_key`].
//! * a pointer that is no member of the `Stage` shape is read as such a method path, so
//!   it is refused as one — see [`STAGE_INVALID_PATCH_PATH`].
//! * `accessLogSettings` and `canarySettings`, structures whose own members are
//!   addressed the way a top-level member is, and which a `remove` of the structure
//!   itself turns off.
//!
//! A `copy` is the canary PROMOTION rather than a patch of a member, so its legal
//! `(path, from)` pairs are a grammar of their own — see [`CANARY_PROMOTIONS`].
//!
//! An `add` names one entry of a collection the stage keys by name and nothing else: every
//! other pointer of a stage names a member that is already there, which is `replace`d, so
//! an `add` of one is refused — see [`add_names_an_entry`]. A `remove` takes away the parts
//! of a stage that can go away; a pointer that is none of them is read as a method
//! setting's path, so it is answered with that sentence — see [`remove_method_setting`].
//! A patch `value` for a boolean member is READ rather than validated: see [`stage_bool`].
//!
//! Shared types live in `super::types`; the error channel in `crate::scaffolded`.

//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `patchOperations` (ListOfPatchOperation) — For more information about supported patch
//!   operations, see Patch Operations.
//! * `restApiId` (String) **required** — The string identifier of the associated RestApi.
//! * `stageName` (String) **required** — The name of the Stage resource to change information
//!   about.

//!   DELETE_IN_PROGRESS | FLUSH_IN_PROGRESS | NOT_AVAILABLE) — The status of the cache
//!   cluster for the stage, if enabled.

//!   overriding all methods in the stage.
//! * `stageName` (String) — The name of the stage is the first path segment in the Uniform
//!   Resource Identifier (URI) of a call to API Gateway. Stage names can only contain
//!   alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Maximum length is 128 characters.
//! * `tags` (MapOfStringToString) — The collection of tags. Each tag element is associated
//!   with a given resource.
//! * `tracingEnabled` (Boolean, default false) **required** — Specifies whether active
//!   tracing with X-ray is enabled for the Stage.
//! * `variables` (MapOfStringToString) — A map that defines the stage variables for a Stage
//!   resource. Variable names can have alphanumeric and underscore characters, and the values
//!   must match [A-Za-z0-9-._~:/?#&=,]+.
//! * `webAclArn` (String) — The ARN of the WebAcl associated with the Stage.
//!
//! ## Errors
//!

//!   input is incomplete or incorrect. See the accompanying error message for details.
//! * `ConflictException` (HTTP 409) — The request configuration has conflicts. For details,
//!   see the accompanying error message.
//! * `LimitExceededException` (HTTP 429) — The request exceeded the rate limit. Retry after
//!   the specified time period.
//! * `NotFoundException` (HTTP 404) — The requested resource is not found. Make sure that the
//!   request URI is correct.
//! * `TooManyRequestsException` (HTTP 429) — The request has reached its throttling limit.
//!   Retry after the specified time period.
//! * `UnauthorizedException` (HTTP 401) — The request is denied because the caller has
//!   insufficient permissions.
