//! What a service's DEFAULT-QUOTA SET may be published as, over the wire.
//!
//! `ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas(ServiceCode)` reports the service's published
//! default-quota catalog, and `QuotaCode` is the only key Service Quotas exposes: it is
//! what `GetAWSDefaultServiceQuota`, `GetServiceQuota` and `RequestServiceQuotaIncrease`
//! take. So a short hand-written table keyed on codes derived from quota NAMES hands a
//! client keys no other API accepts and values that are not the service's defaults. The
//! rules asserted here, each over a TABLE of services rather than one case:
//!
//! * a service's whole published catalog is served — every row keyed on the
//!   `L-XXXXXXXX` code AWS mints, none keyed on a code derived from a quota name, and
//!   the catalog is as long as the service's published one;
//! * every row reports that service's published `ServiceName`, the same string
//!   `ListServices` reports for the code;
//! * a published row reports the `QuotaName`, `Value`, `Unit`, `Adjustable`,
//!   `GlobalQuota`, `Period` and `UsageMetric` AWS publishes for the quota, with a
//!   `QuotaArn` naming the Region it was read at and no account, identically through the
//!   listing and through `GetAWSDefaultServiceQuota`, and the same code resolves in the
//!   APPLIED listing;
//! * a code this catalog used to derive from a quota name is published nowhere and
//!   resolves nowhere.
//!
//! The harness (`client`, `emulator`, `default_quotas`, `walk_pages`) is the one
//! `quota_workflow.rs` owns, and the question "is this a code AWS mints" is asked
//! through `catalog_identity.rs`'s single copy of it.
