//! The METADATA a published default-quota row carries under its `QuotaCode`, over the
//! wire.
//!
//! A `QuotaCode` is the identity Service Quotas publishes one quota under, and the row
//! published under it carries THAT quota's `QuotaName`, `Value`, `Unit`, `Adjustable`,
//! `Period`, `UsageMetric` and `Description` as the service publishes them. Two things
//! follow, and both are asserted here over a TABLE spanning ten `ServiceCode`s rather
//! than over one row:
//!
//! * every pinned code reports the quota published under it — so a counted plane never
//!   carries a request rate's numbers, a measured plane reports its own `Unit`/`Value`
//!   pair, and a row metered by a resource count is never published over a rate window;
//! * the `Description` is the service's own published text, not a sentence the server
//!   composes: so a row that is NOT metered by an API's call count is never described as
//!   a per-API request rate, and a row that IS so metered is described in the wording its
//!   own service publishes, naming the API its metric meters.
//!
//! The rows differ along everything those rules generalise over: a per-API rate metered
//! by a call count and worded as EventBridge words it (`events`) and as the other
//! services word it (`firehose`), a resource plane metered by a resource count over the
//! window those counts are published on (`events`), a plane counted on a RESOURCE with a
//! per-resource context (`events`), counted planes with no window at all (`fms`, `fsx`,
//! `gamelift`, `glue`, `groundstation`, `guardduty`, `imagebuilder`), a floor rather than
//! a ceiling (`glacier` archive size) and sizes in megabytes, gigabytes and kilobytes,
//! adjustable and not-adjustable rows, and values from 1 to 524,288.
//!
//! SOURCE for every row: the recorded `ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas` response of that
//! `ServiceCode`, which states which quota each code publishes and the text of the
//! members quoted here.
//!
//! The harness (`client`, `emulator`, `default_quotas`) is the one `quota_workflow.rs`
//! owns.
