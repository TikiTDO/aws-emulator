//! The published TEXT of a default-quota row of these ten catalogs: it belongs to that
//! row's own quota, and a row whose published text no source states carries none.
//!
//! THE RULE: a row published under a `QuotaCode` carries the `QuotaName`, `Value`,
//! `Unit`, `Adjustable`, `Period`, `UsageMetric` and `Description` of the quota the
//! service publishes UNDER THAT CODE — the description as the service words it, never a
//! paraphrase and never a neighbouring quota's. Two consequences of the `Description`
//! half are asserted here, and neither is reachable from a per-row table (the per-row
//! facts live in `aws_quota_metadata_per_code.rs`, the per-catalog code and name
//! invariants in `aws_minted_catalog_coverage.rs`):
//!
//! * inside one `ServiceCode` no two rows carry the SAME `Description`. A description is
//!   the sentence the service publishes for one quota, so a sentence appearing twice means
//!   one of the two rows is describing the other's quota — the borrowed-text half of this
//!   catalog's defect, which a name or code check cannot see;
//! * the rows whose published sentence no source available here states carry NO
//!   `Description` at all, rather than one the catalog words itself. The pairs are named
//!   below, so a sentence invented for one of them later fails this test, and a row
//!   outside the list that loses its description fails it too.
//!
//! The walk spans the ten `ServiceCode`s this change re-keyed and reads them over the
//! wire through `ListAWSDefaultServiceQuotas` (paged by the shared harness), so both
//! invariants are asserted on the served response rather than on the seed table.
//!
//! The harness (`client`, `emulator`, `default_quotas`) is the one `quota_workflow.rs`
//! owns.
