//! What the default-quota catalog publishes for a service whose rows AWS keys on its
//! OWN `QuotaCode`, over the wire.
//!
//! `QuotaCode` is the only key Service Quotas exposes — `GetAWSDefaultServiceQuota`,
//! `GetServiceQuota` and `RequestServiceQuotaIncrease` all take it — so the rules
//! asserted here are about the identity and the content of a published row rather than
//! about one recorded listing:
//!
//! * a published row is keyed on the `L-XXXXXXXX` code AWS mints for that quota and
//!   reports the `QuotaName`, `Value`, `Unit`, `Adjustable`, `GlobalQuota`,
//!   `Description`, `Period` and `UsageMetric` AWS publishes UNDER THAT CODE,
//!   identically through the listing and through the single read, with a `QuotaArn`
//!   naming the Region it was read at and no account;
//! * a code built out of a quota's NAME is published nowhere and resolves nowhere, and
//!   neither does a code in AWS's namespace this catalog cannot cite a quota for — so a
//!   client never reads back a quota this emulator invented;
//! * a quota AWS publishes as a quota OF A RESOURCE reports the whole `QuotaContext` it
//!   publishes — the plane the quota is counted on, that plane's resource type and the
//!   level an increase may be asked for at — and its value resolves on that plane as
//!   well as account-wide.
//!
//! The tables span rate quotas published with no window, category rate quotas published
//! over a one-second window with an `AWS/Usage` call count — on one user pool's plane and
//! on the account's — resource planes metered with an `AWS/Usage` resource count over the
//! five-minute window those counts are published over, plain counts, a quota measured in
//! megabytes rather than counted, adjustable and fixed rows, and values from 1 to 1000 —
//! and the last table drives the same rules through two services this suite's issue never
//! cited.
//!
//! The harness (`client`, `emulator`, `default_quotas`, `walk_pages`) is the one
//! `quota_workflow.rs` owns, and "is this a code AWS mints" is asked through
//! `catalog_identity.rs`'s single copy of that question.
