//! The QUEUE's own resource policy decides whether a rule's SQS target receives a
//! matched event, end to end over the wire (`awsJson1_1`, `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: AWSEvents.<Operation>`) through the real `MultiServiceRouter`, with
//! Amazon SQS and CloudWatch mounted on the same engine so a delivery is asserted
//! where a client observes one: on the queue, and on the rule's invocation metrics.
//!
//! The RULE asserted here: "for Lambda functions, Amazon SNS topics and Amazon SQS
//! queues, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies" (`PutTargets`), and the
//! call EventBridge makes on a queue target is `sqs:SendMessage` as the service
//! principal `events.amazonaws.com`. A service principal holds no identity-based
//! policies, so the queue's own `Policy` attribute is the ONLY document in force:
//! nothing is enqueued unless that document states an `Allow` about this principal,
//! this action and this queue; an explicit `Deny` about it refuses the delivery
//! whatever is granted beside it, in whichever order the two are written; and a
//! statement conditioned on `aws:SourceArn` or `aws:SourceAccount` authorizes the
//! deliveries of the rule and the account it names and no others. A refused delivery
//! is one that FAILED, so it is counted on the rule's `FailedInvocations` and sent to
//! the target's dead-letter queue — which is the same send by the same principal, so
//! that queue's own policy decides it the same way. What the dead letter REPORTS is
//! the answer Amazon SQS gave the refused `sqs:SendMessage`: an authorization
//! failure naming the principal, the action and the queue, so the condition names
//! the PERMISSION (`NO_PERMISSIONS`) — the identity the call was made as was not
//! allowed it, while the queue was there all along — and the message is that
//! answer, carrying the id of the refused request.
//!
//! The first test spans a TABLE whose rows differ along what the queue's document
//! states: whether there is one at all, which principal it names, which action and
//! which resource its statements are about, which `Effect` they state and in which
//! order, and which condition they are scoped by. Each row is a FRESH emulator, so
//! one row's document never decides another row's delivery.
//!
//! The condition operators the rows use (`ArnEquals`, `ArnLike`, `StringEquals`,
//! `Null`) and the keys they read are IAM's own, because a queue's `Policy` is an IAM
//! policy document — `smithy_query(query="doc",shape="com.amazonaws.sqs#QueueAttributeName")`
//! for the attribute itself.
//!
//! The harness (the router with EventBridge, Amazon SQS, Step Functions, IAM and
//! CloudWatch on one engine) is `tests/all/target_dispatch.rs`'s, which is also where
//! the grant a target queue needs is written once ([`granting_events`]).
