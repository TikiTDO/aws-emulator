//! The connection resource end to end over the wire (`awsJson1_1`, `POST /` with
//! `X-Amz-Target: AWSEvents.<Operation>`) through the real `MultiServiceRouter`:
//! `CreateConnection` writes it, `DescribeConnection` reports it back,
//! `DeauthorizeConnection` strips its credentials and `DeleteConnection` removes
//! it.
//!
//! The RULES asserted here:
//!
//! * a created connection is a PERSISTED resource: it answers an ARN of the
//!   modelled `ConnectionArn` form (`…:connection/<name>/<id>`), it is readable
//!   back under its name through `DescribeConnection` with every member it was
//!   created with, and its ARN and timestamps do not change between reads;
//! * a connection AWS answers in a non-terminal state reaches its next state on
//!   its own, a moment later rather than instantly: `DEAUTHORIZING` ->
//!   `DEAUTHORIZED`, `DELETING` -> gone. A caller reading straight after the call
//!   still observes the transient state, while a connection the call itself
//!   settled (`AUTHORIZED`) stays where it is;
//! * no credential a connection was created with is ever reported: the response
//!   parameters carry a user name, an API key NAME and a client id, and never the
//!   password, key value or client secret;
//! * the name is the connection's identity — a second create under one name is
//!   `ResourceAlreadyExistsException`, and every operation naming a connection
//!   that does not exist is `ResourceNotFoundException`;
//! * "you must include only authorization parameters for the AuthorizationType
//!   you specify" (`CreateConnection$AuthParameters`), so a request whose
//!   parameters do not match its type is refused.
//!
//! Each table spans the class rather than one recorded case: the rows differ
//! along the authorization type and its parameter block, along which member of a
//! request is wrong, and along which operation names a connection that is not
//! there.
