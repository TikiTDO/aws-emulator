//! What the AWS-managed platform catalog REPORTS about the platforms it
//! publishes, driven end to end over the service's awsQuery HTTP surface.
//!
//! Three rules, each asserted over a SET of inputs rather than over one recorded
//! case:
//!
//! 1. The catalog publishes every platform Elastic Beanstalk has published under
//!    the `PlatformName` it groups that platform's branches by — including a
//!    platform whose whole branch history has retired, which is published under
//!    its own platform name — so a `PlatformName` filter reports that platform's
//!    branches instead of an empty list.
//! 2. `ListPlatformVersions` reports `PlatformLifecycleState` on EVERY summary:
//!    `PlatformSummary$PlatformLifecycleState` documents "Possible values:
//!    `recommended` | empty" and "If an empty value is returned, the platform
//!    version is supported but isn't the recommended one for its branch", so the
//!    member is present with an empty value on a version that is not its
//!    branch's recommended one and carries the state on the one that is.
//! 3. Every `CustomAmiList` entry of a published platform version names its
//!    virtualization type AND the machine image the version runs for that type:
//!    the entry for the virtualization type the version ships an image for
//!    carries an image id of the form EC2 issues one in, the same id on every
//!    read, and no two versions share an image.
//!
//! The expectations are computed from the service's own published catalog
//! (`eb::state::SOLUTION_STACKS`, what `ListAvailableSolutionStacks` reports) and
//! from the rules above; the one hand-written table names its source and covers
//! platforms this issue did not cite.
//!
//! The HTTP harness ([`crate::lifecycle::Emulator`]) and the branch reader
//! ([`crate::platform_branches`]) are the ones the other platform suites use, so
//! this suite adds no second copy of either.
