//! The Elastic Beanstalk application / application-version / environment lifecycle,

//!
//! Every test here mounts this one service in the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! production binary uses and speaks to it the way an AWS client does: a
//! form-urlencoded `Action=…` body in, an XML envelope out. Nothing in THIS
//! suite reaches into the store directly, so a create that does not persist, or
//! a describe that answers from anything other than the store, fails these
//! tests.
//!
//! The harness ([`Emulator`], [`Answer`]) is `pub(crate)` so the other suites in
//! this test target drive the emulator the same way instead of copying it;
//! [`Emulator::store`] is there for a suite that has to seed a precondition no
//! implemented operation can produce yet.
//!
//! [`Emulator`] and [`Answer`] are `pub(crate)`: every other suite in this one
//! test target (see `tests/all.rs`) drives the service through them rather than
//! standing up a second harness of its own.
//!
//! The two helpers at the bottom — the form-value encoder and the element reader
//! — are written here rather than taken from a crate ON PURPOSE: a dependency
//! would have to be recorded in `Cargo.lock`, the one file this branch shares
//! with every other fix landing on mainline, and that shared hunk is what kept
//! this change's squash merge colliding. Both are a few lines over the
//! emulator's OWN output: the encoder is SigV4's unreserved-set rule, and the
//! reader slices the text between the opening and closing tag of an element in
//! a document this service generated (no CDATA, no comments), allowing the
//! `xmlns` attribute the first member of a list repeats and counting nested
//! tags of the same name so a `<member>` inside a `<member>` is read whole.
//!
//! This module also OWNS that harness for the suites beside it: `Emulator`,
//! `Answer` and the element reader are `pub(crate)`, so the other suites in this
//! test target — `all/operations_role.rs`, `all/solution_stacks.rs`,
//! `all/events.rs` and the rest — drive the same router over the same wire
//! rather than each repeating one.
