//! The rule under test: an `EnvironmentName` "must be unique within a region in

//! refused synchronously with `InvalidParameterValue` and the sentence the
//! service words that with — and the name is free again once the environment
//! holding it has reached `Terminated` ("Environment is not running"), where the
//! identical create succeeds with a NEW `EnvironmentId`. A client that walks that
//! sequence reads each status back off `DescribeEnvironments`, which reports the
//! records NEWEST first, so the record it reads for a name it has just re-created
//! is the one it just created rather than the terminated one it replaced.
//!
//! The table spans what the rule generalises over: which identifier the
//! terminate and the reads name the environment by, and whether the re-create
//! reuses the CNAME prefix the terminated environment held.
