//! The rule under test: the key of a delivered object is the evaluated prefix followed by
//! `<stream name>-<version>-yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss-<uuid><file extension>` — the stream's own
//! name, the decimal stream version `DescribeDeliveryStream` reports as `VersionId` for the
//! configuration the delivery was made under, the delivery's own second, and a value unique
//! to the object, with nothing else between them. So the tail of a key parses into exactly
//! those four parts, the version part tracks the `VersionId` across a configuration change,
//! and two objects of one stream delivered in the same second are told apart by the unique
//! part alone.
