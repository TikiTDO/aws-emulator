//! WHEN a stream's buffer becomes an Amazon S3 object: the destination's `BufferingHints`.
//!
//! The rule under test: Firehose holds the records a put accepted and delivers them once the
//! FIRST of the destination's two buffering conditions is met — `IntervalInSeconds` after the
//! buffer opened ("Buffer incoming data for the specified period of time, in seconds, before
//! delivering it to the destination") or as soon as the buffer holds `SizeInMBs` ("Buffer
//! incoming data to the specified size, in MiBs, before delivering it to the destination"),
//! with the documented defaults (300 s, 5 MiB) standing where the configuration names
//! neither. Each flushed buffer becomes ONE object. The hints that decide a window are the
//! ones of the destination member the stream was created with, whichever member carries the
//! Amazon S3 location every record passes through: the plain `S3DestinationConfiguration`,
//! the extended one, or the `S3Configuration` of an Amazon Redshift destination ("Firehose
//! first delivers data to the S3 bucket and then issues an Amazon Redshift COPY command").
//!
//! So a destination's bucket holds NOTHING for a record put inside a longer interval, holds
//! one object for the same record once that interval has passed, and holds one as soon as the
//! records cross the configured size however long the interval is.
//!
//! Every row asserts that window rather than any particular latency, and no case waits for a
//! fixed time or reads the wall clock: a destination is read right after its own put, a
//! destination that IS due is polled until it holds its object, and the destinations whose
//! interval is minutes away are required to hold nothing at every reading taken while that
//! polling runs.
//!
//! The rows here vary the HINT VALUES of one destination member; the sibling suite
//! `buffering_hints_destination_members` varies the MEMBER carrying them, and drives its own
//! rows through [`assert_window_rule`] below, so there is one table-driver and one reading of
//! "delivered" and "not delivered yet" between the two.
