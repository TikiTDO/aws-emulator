//! What a delivered Amazon S3 object says its bytes are: `Content-Type` and
//! `Content-Encoding`.
//!
//! The rule under test: Firehose encodes a delivered object's body as the destination's
//! `CompressionFormat` asks ("the compression format. If no value is specified, the default
//! is UNCOMPRESSED" — `ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration$CompressionFormat`) and states that
//! encoding on the object it writes, as the content coding the format names — the format's
//! own value in lower case — while an `UNCOMPRESSED` object carries no coding at all. The
//! media type is the same for every format: Firehose does not interpret the records' bytes,
//! so a delivered object is an opaque byte stream.
//!
//! So a consumer that reads the object's metadata to choose a decoder is told which one the
//! bytes are for, and can tell a `zip` object from a `gzip` one.
