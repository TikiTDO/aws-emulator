//! WHICH `BufferingHints` decide a buffer's window: the ones of the destination member the
//! stream was created with, whichever member that is.
//!
//! The rule under test is the one the `buffering_hints` suite states and whose table-driver
//! these rows reuse — a buffer is delivered once the FIRST of the two conditions its
//! destination's own `BufferingHints` state is met, `IntervalInSeconds` after it opened or
//! as soon as it holds `SizeInMBs`, with the documented defaults (300 s, 5 MiB) where the
//! configuration names neither. What these rows vary is the MEMBER carrying those hints:
//! every destination member with an Amazon S3 location that every ingested record passes
//! through buffers by its own hints — the plain `S3DestinationConfiguration`, the extended
//! one, and the `S3Configuration` of an Amazon Redshift destination ("Firehose first
//! delivers data to the S3 bucket and then issues an Amazon Redshift COPY command").
//!
//! So a record put into a destination configured with a minutes-long interval is in NO
//! member's bucket while that interval runs, however the destination was spelled.
