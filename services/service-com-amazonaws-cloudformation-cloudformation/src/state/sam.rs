//! The `AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31` transform: expanding a SAM template into the
//! CloudFormation resources it stands for.
//!
//! "The optional Transform section … specifies one or more macros that CloudFormation uses
//! to process your template", and CloudFormation processes those macros BEFORE it does
//! anything with the template's `Resources`: a change set plans, and a stack deploys, the
//! PROCESSED template. `AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31` is the macro the AWS Serverless
//! Application Model is published as, and what it processes is every `AWS::Serverless::*`
//! resource — a type that exists only as that macro's INPUT, never as a resource
//! CloudFormation creates. So a template declaring the transform is expanded here, by
//! [`expand`], before [`super::template::parse`] reads a single resource out of it; every
//! reader of a template body (a change set's plan, a deployment's resources, a stack's
//! outputs) therefore sees the concrete resources and never the macro's input types.
//!
//! What the expansion is, per the SAM resource reference ("AWS SAM resource and property
//! reference" and "Generated AWS CloudFormation resources" in the AWS SAM Developer
//! Guide):
//!
//! * `AWS::Serverless::Function` becomes an `AWS::Lambda::Function`, plus the
//!   `AWS::IAM::Role` it executes as when the declaration names no `Role` of its own, plus
//!   one resource per event the function is triggered by — an `AWS::Lambda::Permission` for
//!   each API event, an `AWS::Lambda::EventSourceMapping` for each stream or queue event,
//!   an `AWS::Events::Rule` for each schedule or event-pattern event, an
//!   `AWS::SNS::Subscription` for each topic event.
//! * An `Api` event that names no `RestApiId` is an IMPLICIT API: the transform synthesizes
//!   ONE `AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi` (`ServerlessRestApi`) whose OpenAPI body carries the
//!   path and method of every such event in the template, and deploys it — an
//!   `AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment` and an `AWS::ApiGateway::Stage` for the implicit `Prod`
//!   stage. That deployment declares a `StageName` of its own ([`EXTRA_STAGE`]), so the
//!   deployed REST API carries that stage beside the one its stage resource serves. A
//!   `HttpApi` event does the same through `AWS::ApiGatewayV2::Api` and its `$default` stage.
//! * `AWS::Serverless::Api` and `AWS::Serverless::HttpApi` become that same API trio from
//!   the definition the declaration states — and "if neither `DefinitionUri` nor
//!   `DefinitionBody` are specified, AWS SAM generates [one] based on your template
//!   configuration": the API's definition is generated from the routes of the events routed
//!   through it ([`api_definition_paths`]), whether that API is the implicit one or one a
//!   declaration spells, so an API the transform emits always carries the definition that
//!   NAMES it. An HTTP API is created by IMPORTING that document, so what the declaration
//!   says about the api itself — its name, description, CORS and endpoint configuration and
//!   its tags — travels inside it ([`http_definition_members`]).
//! * A declaration's `Policies` is what the role generated for it grants: every entry that
//!   is not an AWS managed policy becomes one INLINE policy on that role, named for the
//!   declaration and the entry's position ([`role_policies`]), and the role carries the
//!   managed policy each of the function's event sources needs
//!   ([`EVENT_SOURCE_POLICIES`]).
//! * `AWS::Serverless::SimpleTable` becomes an `AWS::DynamoDB::Table`,
//!   `AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion` an `AWS::Lambda::LayerVersion` and
//!   `AWS::Serverless::StateMachine` an `AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine` (plus its
//!   execution role).
//!
//! ## A deployment's logical id carries a content hash
//!
//! An `AWS::ApiGateway::Deployment` is immutable once created, so "AWS SAM … creates a new
//! deployment whenever the API's definition changes" by giving each deployment a logical id
//! of its own: the deployment's logical id is `<api>Deployment` followed by a hash of the
//! API's definition ([`DIGEST_CHARS`] hex characters), and the stage points at that id. The
//! same definition therefore plans the same single deployment, and an edited definition
//! plans a different one — which is the property [`digest`] gives it. The DIGEST FUNCTION
//! is not observable (nothing reads the hash back), so this module uses the crate's
//! existing SHA-256; what is observable is the shape of the id and that it is a function of
//! the definition's CONTENT, both of which hold here. An
//! `AWS::Serverless::LayerVersion` carries the same content hash on its own logical id, for
//! the same reason: a layer version cannot be updated in place. Both are derived through the
//! crate's one digest derivation ([`super::template::content_digest`]).
//!
//! An expansion that RENAMES a declaration re-points every reference to it
//! ([`rename_references`]): CloudFormation plans and deploys the macro's OUTPUT, so a `Ref`,
//! an `Fn::GetAtt`, an `Fn::Sub` variable or a `DependsOn` naming the declaration's own
//! logical id has to name the expanded one, in every section of the processed template.
//! Nothing else is renamed, so every other reference reads exactly as the template wrote it.
//!
//! ## What is left as declared
//!
//! An `AWS::Serverless::Application` resolves its template from the AWS Serverless
//! Application Repository, which needs an outbound connection this emulator does not make,
//! and an `AWS::Serverless::GraphQLApi` or `AWS::Serverless::Connector` expansion is not
//! modelled here: those declarations are left exactly as the template spells them rather
//! than expanded into resources nothing computed. The same holds for an event type this
//! module does not carry — it contributes no resource, instead of a fabricated one. Every
//! OTHER macro (`AWS::Include`, a private one) is still unexpanded: this module answers for
//! the SAM transform alone, which is why [`super::resource_types`] keeps admitting the
//! types a template declaring any transform spells.
//!
//! ## Bounds
//!
//! The expansion is driven by a template body that is already bounded
//! ([`super::template::parse`] refuses an over-long body, too many nodes and too much
//! nesting before this module sees it), and it adds a bounded number of resources per
//! declaration, so no caller-controlled input can make it loop or recurse unboundedly: the
//! one recursive walk here ([`canonical`], over a value being hashed) carries its own depth
//! bound. The documented per-template resource quota is applied to the EXPANDED template,
//! which is the one CloudFormation validates.
