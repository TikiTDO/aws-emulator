//! Whether the CALLER's own identity-based IAM policies let a request to this service
//! perform the action it asks for — the decision an operation takes before it resolves
//! anything the request names.
//!
//! AWS decides a signed call against the calling principal's identity-based policies
//! before the service evaluates what the request names, so a caller holding no grant is
//! told it is not authorized rather than told whether the resource it named exists, and a
//! refused write changes nothing. CodePipeline models no error shape for that refusal, so
//! it travels as the AWS COMMON error every service answers it with
//! ([`crate::scaffolded::Scaffolded::access_denied`] — `AccessDeniedException`, HTTP 400).
//!
//! The three pieces, each held in exactly one place:
//!
//! 1. **who** — the principal the request's access key id speaks for, read from the SAME
//!    place `sts:GetCallerIdentity` answers from for a session credential, and from IAM's
//!    own access-key map (the map `iam:GetUser` resolves a caller through) for a long-term
//!    key, so the principal a refusal blames is the one the caller reads back for the
//!    credentials it signed with;
//! 2. **what it may do** — the identity-based policy documents in force on that principal
//!    and the permissions boundary that caps them, read through the IAM service's OWN
//!    accessors, where the collection rule itself lives;
//! 3. **the decision** — [`::service_common::iam_authorization`], the one shared evaluation
//!    of those documents against `(action, resource)` AND the one wording of the refusal
//!    it answers with ([`iam::not_authorized_by_identity_policy`] and its reason clauses),
//!    so this service and every other one handed the same documents answer alike.
//!
//! Only the store LOOKUPS live here; neither the collection nor the decision does. They
//! stay in this service crate because the IAM service crate depends on `service-common`,
//! so the shared crate cannot read IAM's store without a dependency cycle — the same
//! reason the other services that decide this keep their lookups beside their own state.
//!
//! ## The two callers the decision cannot refuse
//!
//! * **The account's own published credential.** A request whose access key id neither STS
//!   nor IAM holds a record for resolves to the account's own identity, which is not a
//!   principal the IAM store holds policies for — the position AWS account root
//!   credentials are in. Such a request is allowed.
//! * **A principal holding an attachment this emulator cannot read.** An AWS-managed policy
//!   is owned by AWS, not by the account, so the IAM store holds no document for it. A
//!   principal with such a policy attached is allowed: this service cannot see what that
//!   document grants, and refusing on evidence it does not have would deny access AWS
//!   permits.
//!
//! An expired session credential speaks for nobody: it carries no document, so every action
//! it asks for is refused, and the refusal names the credential that was presented rather
//! than a blank principal.
//!
//! The decision is taken with no guard of this service's own store held, and it writes
//! nothing to either store it reads.
