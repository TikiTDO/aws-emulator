//! WHICH structures of this service carry the awsJson shape discriminator, and the shape
//! name each one carries.
//!
//! This service speaks `awsJson1_1` (`smithy_query query="service_info"`), and on that
//! protocol two of its structures arrive at a client carrying `__type` — the member the
//! awsJson family names a serialized shape with — beside the members the shape declares:
//!
//! ```text
//! "actionTypeId": {"__type": "ActionTypeId", "category": "Source", "owner": "AWS", …}
//! "encryptionKey": {"__type": "EncryptionKey", "id": "…", "type": "KMS"}
//! ```
//!
//! `__type` is a PROTOCOL member rather than a modelled one: the model declares it
//! nowhere, so the generated serializer (which writes exactly the members the shape
//! declares) cannot emit it, and a client that keys such a structure's shape off that
//! discriminator — the same discriminator it reads an error's class from — finds nothing.
//! The framework writes one for an ERROR body
//! (`vendor/smithy-schema-server/src/rpc.rs`'s `__TYPE_MEMBER_SCHEMA`), but nothing on the
//! success path does, and `vendor/` is read-only. So it is written on the SERVICE side,
//! by the serializer in [`crate::service::action_type_wire_form`], over the catalog here.
//!
//! The two shapes a recorded response of this service shows it on are `ActionTypeId` and
//! `EncryptionKey` — the two structures this API reuses across its planes: an action
//! type's identity and an artifact store's KMS key, each appearing in a pipeline's
//! structure, in a catalog entry, in an action execution and in a job's data alike. The
//! rule is per SHAPE and not per operation, so it holds wherever one of them is
//! serialized. No other structure of this service carries one: a recorded response shows
//! the discriminator on these two shapes and on nothing enclosing them, so nothing else is
//! given one here.
