//! This front door's AUDIT leg: every call it serves is a management event of
//! `codepipeline.amazonaws.com`, recorded in the account's event history where
//! CloudTrail's `LookupEvents` reads it.
//!
//! Every control-plane call of an account is a management event, which makes the recording
//! a property of SERVING a call and not of any one operation — so it is not written per
//! handler here. The shared wrapper ([`service_common::audited_operation`]) is handed the
//! deserialized input before the handler runs, the handler's own `Result` after, and the
//! rendered response last, and this module is only what THIS service contributes to each
//! record:
//!
//! * its `eventSource` ([`EVENT_SOURCE`]);
//! * the Region and the account the call was served for;
//! * the session a call's temporary credential belongs to, so a decision submitted by a
//!   role session is attributed to that session and to the role that issued it;
//! * the members whose values its records WITHHOLD ([`SENSITIVE_MEMBERS`]); and
//! * which operations REPORT state and which CHANGE it — the one fact a record cannot read
//!   off a request, so it is stated per operation in [`audited_table`].
//!
//! Every request this service serves reaches that table, because it is the routing table
//! this service's definition answers with
//! ([`service_common::audited_operation::AuditedDefinition`]) — so no request can be served
//! by a path that records nothing.
//!
//! A call this emulator has not implemented answers 501 and is NOT recorded: the wrapper
//! drops it, because event history is the record of the calls an account's APIs actually
//! served.
