//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-transfer-transferservice service.
//!
//! Everything AWS Transfer Family's server + user + web app + AS2 profile + connector
//! + host-key lifecycle needs to answer a read from stored state lives here: the
//! resource maps (servers, their users and host keys, the web apps `ListWebApps`
//! pages, the AS2 profiles, the AS2 agreements a server's profiles trade under, the
//! connectors, and the
//! workflows a server's
//! `WorkflowDetails` attach), the
//! id-minting counter, the
//! documented create-time defaults and the clock-due server state transitions (the
//! `ServerTransition` rule `StartServer`/`StopServer` share), the ARN shapes, and the
//! opaque pagination token codec the `List*` operations share.
//!
//! The service-managed security policy catalog ([`SECURITY_POLICIES`]) lives here too.
//! No operation creates or changes a security policy — a server or connector only
//! attaches one by name — so the catalog is published data rather than per-account
//! state, and `DescribeSecurityPolicy` answers out of it.
//!
//! A tag set is NOT a map of its own: it belongs to the resource that carries it, so
//! the tag plane ([`ComAmazonawsTransferTransferserviceState::tags_of`],
//! [`ComAmazonawsTransferTransferserviceState::tags_mut`]) resolves a resource by its
//! stored ARN and reads or rewrites that resource's own `tags` — which is why a tag
//! written through `TagResource` is at once what the resource's own reader reports.
//!
//! The verdict `TestConnection` reports on a stored SFTP connector STARTS here
//! ([`TEST_CONNECTION_STATUS_ERROR`], [`sftp_configuration_defect`]) — the defects that
//! connector's stored configuration carries on its own — and is decided in
//! [`sftp_target`], which resolves the endpoint the connector's `Url` names against
//! this same store and answers for the connection to it. [`connector_delivery`] is the
//! other half of that endpoint: it carries an accepted transfer out against it.
//!
//! `UserCount` and `SshPublicKeyCount` are DERIVED at read time ([`
//! ComAmazonawsTransferTransferserviceState::user_count`],
//! [`User::ssh_public_key_count`]) rather than stored, so they cannot go stale when a
//! user or a key is added or removed. Every other member a reader reports is RESOLVED
//! once, when the resource is created or updated, so no reader has to re-apply a
//! default.
//!
//! The [`authorization`] submodule is the one gate — the server, user, SSH-key and
//! access-creating operations consult it before they act, and the other implemented
//! families do not yet (its own header records that scope): it reads the calling
//! principal's — and a passed role's — IAM policies out of the account's IAM store.
//!
//! The `Message` of a not-found, an already-exists or a documented state refusal is
//! built here, as a FIXED text per condition that carries no request data: the
//! identifier a caller needs to see travels in the error's own `Resource`/
//! `ResourceType` members, so an id can never reach a message a client logs or asserts
//! on, and a text can never be derived from an internal name. The ONE exception is a
//! condition whose recorded wording itself names the resource in the text
//! ([`no_web_app_customization`]): the service's own words are the requirement, so that
//! text is reproduced as a template whose variable part is read off the REQUEST, never
//! off an internal name. A handler still words
//! its own refusals for conditions this module holds no text for (a store-capacity
//! refusal, say); the one message built from the request is the framework's
//! `ValidationException`, whose template (member path + modelled constraint, no value)
//! lives in `crate::service`.

// map here — they RESOLVE a resource by the ARN the caller sends and then read or
// rewrite that resource's existing set, which is why a tag written through
// `TagResource` is immediately visible to `DescribeServer`, `DescribeUser`,
// `DescribeHostKey`, `DescribeWebApp`, `DescribeProfile`, `DescribeConnector` and
// `DescribeWorkflow` without any of them changing.

/// How many tags ONE resource carries before a tag write is refused instead of
/// growing the set.

/// reports a resource's tag set through — `ListTagsForResource`'s output member and
/// each `Describe*`'s — so a set past 50 could not be reported without violating the
