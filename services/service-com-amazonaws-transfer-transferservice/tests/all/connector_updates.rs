//! What `UpdateConnector` writes to a stored connector, and what it refuses.
//!
//! Four rules, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one recorded call:
//!
//! 1. an update is a PARTIAL write: every member the request names replaces the stored
//!    one, every member it does not name keeps the value the connector already had, and
//!    a later `DescribeConnector` reports exactly that
//!    ([`an_update_replaces_the_members_it_names_and_leaves_the_rest`]);
//! 2. an `EgressConfig` update MODIFIES the VPC Lattice settings the connector already
//!    has, member by member, and is refused for a connector that has none — `EgressType`
//!    is not an updatable member
//!    ([`an_egress_update_modifies_the_settings_the_connector_already_has`]);
//! 3. an update whose RESULTING configuration violates a documented cross-member
//!    requirement is refused with the modelled `InvalidRequestException`, and the stored
//!    connector is left exactly as it was
//!    ([`updates_whose_result_cannot_hold_together_are_refused_and_write_nothing`]);
//! 4. a `ConnectorId` the store does not hold answers this service's generic not-found
//!    error ([`updating_a_connector_that_was_never_created_is_not_found`]).
//!
//! The rows differ along which members the request carries and how many, the protocol
//! configuration (AS2 or SFTP), the egress type (service-managed or VPC Lattice), the
//! enum value each member carries, list lengths, and where a numeric member sits
//! relative to its published bounds. The harness (router, request signing,
//! `assert_members`) is the shared [`crate::harness`].
