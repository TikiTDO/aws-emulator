//! The operations a CONNECTOR accepts against the partner's remote endpoint, and the
//! per-file results they are then read back through.
//!
//! Three rules:
//!
//! 1. `StartFileTransfer` accepts a transfer for a stored connector and answers the
//!    identifier it is recorded under, and `ListFileTransferResults` reports one result
//!    per file the request named, IN THE ORDER it named them, each `QUEUED` — the
//!    `TransferTableStatus` for a file whose transfer has not run, which is the only
//!    status this emulator can report for work it makes no outbound connection for.
//!    Those results are reported for an SFTP connector's transfers; asked of an AS2
//!    connector the operation is not supported at all (`crate::connector_protocol_gate`
//!    is that rule's suite).
//! 2. `StartRemoteMove` accepts a move the same way, and refuses a `SourcePath` or
//!    `TargetPath` that is not an absolute path on the remote server with
//!    `InvalidRequestException` (400) — the members document themselves as absolute
//!    paths, and a relative one names no file there.
//! 3. Every one of them resolves the resource it addresses first: a `ConnectorId` the
//!    store does not hold, and a `TransferId` the resolved connector has no record of,
//!    answer `ResourceNotFoundException`.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rules generalise over: how many files a transfer names
//! (one, several, the modelled maximum of ten), which direction it names them in (send,
//! retrieve, both), the connector kind (AS2, SFTP), the page size the results are read
//! at, and the FORM of a path (absolute, bare relative, `./`-relative, a Windows-style
//! one).
