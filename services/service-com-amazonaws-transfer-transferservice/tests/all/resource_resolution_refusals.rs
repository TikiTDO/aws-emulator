//! The four operations that resolve a Transfer resource before they act on it:
//! `TestIdentityProvider`, `DeleteAccess`, `SendWorkflowStepState` and
//! `StartFileTransfer`. (`DescribeWebApp`, the fifth operation of the issue this suite
//! was written for, is covered by the web-app lifecycle suite that landed with
//! `CreateWebApp`.)
//!
//! RULES under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. An operation whose answer depends on a server's `IdentityProviderType` decides on
//!    that type alone: `TestIdentityProvider` is refused 400 `InvalidRequestException`
//!    on every server that delegates authentication to nothing (`SERVICE_MANAGED`), and
//!    gets past that gate on every server that delegates it to a customer-run provider
//!    (`API_GATEWAY`, `AWS_LAMBDA`, `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`); `DeleteAccess` is refused
//!    400 `InvalidRequestException` on every server whose type is not
//!    `AWS_DIRECTORY_SERVICE`, before the `ExternalId` is looked up.
//! 2. An operation that models `AccessDeniedException` answers 403
//!    `AccessDeniedException` for an identifier naming no resource of this account
//!    (`SendWorkflowStepState`'s `WorkflowId` — the resource the action's permission
//!    names) — a refusal that is identical for every such request, so it discloses
//!    nothing about whether the resource exists.
//! 3. An operation that models no `AccessDeniedException`, and an operation past its
//!    authorization decision, answers `ResourceNotFoundException` for an identifier
//!    naming no resource (`TestIdentityProvider` on an unminted server, `DeleteAccess`
//!    for an absent grant, `StartFileTransfer` on an absent connector,
//!    `SendWorkflowStepState` for an execution a resolved workflow is not running),
//!    with `ResourceType` the resource name capitalized and `Resource` the identifier
//!    the request named — at the status that operation answers it with (this service's
//!    recorded 400, and the modelled 404 for `SendWorkflowStepState`'s callback; see
//!    `state::RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND_HTTP_STATUS`).
//! 4. A resource that IS stored is acted on: `DeleteAccess` removes the grant (and a
//!    second delete then cannot find it), and `SendWorkflowStepState` records the
//!    reported `Status` on the custom step its `Token` addresses, ONCE — a replay of a
//!    token whose step has reported addresses no running execution any more, so it is
//!    refused as not found and changes nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what each rule generalises over — the identity-provider type,
//! the id's value, which optional members the request carries, the reported status, the
//! number of pending steps — never along a renamed probe.
//!
//! Resources whose own create operation is still a scaffolded stub (`CreateAccess`)
//! and the workflow executions no emulated data plane starts are SEEDED into the store
//! the handlers read ([`crate::harness::Emulator::store`]), so rules 1 and 4 are
//! asserted on both answers; everything a create DOES serve (servers, connectors,
//! workflows) is created over the wire.
