//! The GuardDuty member-detector configuration loop: `CreateMembers` →
//! `UpdateMemberDetectors` → `GetMemberDetectors`.
//!
//! Every request goes over the wire through `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch`, the same
//! path the production router uses, so these tests exercise routing, restJson1
//! (de)serialization, modelled-constraint validation and the handlers together.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a SET of inputs rather than one recorded
//! call:
//!
//! 1. A member account's configuration is ONE stored switch per feature: an update
//!    writes it and a read reports it back under both views — the `Features` list and
//!    the deprecated `DataSources` nodes — which therefore agree about the status and
//!    the instant it last changed. The instant moves only when the switch CHANGES.
//! 2. An update configures ONLY the switches it names, for ONLY the member accounts it
//!    names: every other feature, and every other member, keeps what it had.
//! 3. A member account's configuration starts where a detector created without a
//!    `Features` list starts: every reported feature enabled except the opt-in ones.
//!    The reported set is every `OrgFeature` member, once each, in canonical order.
//! 4. Configuring a member is not changing the RELATIONSHIP: `GetMembers` reports the
//!    same member record after an update as before it.
//! 5. An account whose member-account detector the administrator does not maintain is
//!    not an error for either operation: the call answers HTTP 200 and names the
//!    account in `unprocessedAccounts` — once per DISTINCT id, in request order — and
//!    persists nothing for it. The member accounts of this suite's fixture are the
//!    ones GuardDuty MONITORS under the administrator, which is the relationship a
//!    member account's detector exists in; the `member_detector_empty_report` suite
//!    owns the partition the read makes over every other relationship.
//! 6. A request the service cannot understand — a value that cannot be an account id,
//!    a `DetectorId` this account/Region does not own, a feature name outside the
//!    `OrgFeature` enum, a status outside `FeatureStatus`, or the two Runtime
//!    Monitoring features asked for together — is refused with HTTP 400 under the
//!    modelled `BadRequestException` shape, and configures nothing.
