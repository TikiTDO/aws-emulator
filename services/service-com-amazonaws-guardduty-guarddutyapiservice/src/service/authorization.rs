//! Whether IAM lets a request to this service perform the action it names — the decision
//! taken BEFORE the operation reads or writes anything, as AWS takes it.
//!
//! An operation of this model that declares `AccessDeniedException` (`httpError` 403,
//! `smithy_query(operation="CreateInvestigation")`) has a modelled answer for a caller
//! whose permissions do not cover the action it asked for, and that answer is what AWS
//! gives: the request is judged at the IAM layer, ahead of the service resolving anything
//! the request named, so the refusal says nothing about whether the detector, the rule or
//! the plan it addressed exists. An operation that declares no 403 has no such answer and
//! is therefore not judged here at all — refusing it with an error its own model does not
//! declare would be a different divergence.
//!
//! Three pieces, each held in exactly one place:
//!
//! 1. **who** — the principal the request's access key id speaks for: the session STS
//!    minted that key for (`sts_store::resolve_caller`, the same record
//!    `sts:GetCallerIdentity` answers from), else the IAM user that owns the long-term
//!    key, else the account's own published credential;
//! 2. **what it may do** — the identity-based policy documents the IAM store holds for
//!    that principal and the permissions boundary that caps them, read through the IAM
//!    service's own accessors (`principal_policies`, `permissions_boundary_document`), so
//!    a document `iam:PutRolePolicy` wrote takes effect on the next request and deleting
//!    it lifts it again;
//! 3. **the decision** — [`::service_common::iam_authorization`], the one shared
//!    evaluation of those documents against `(action, resource)`, so this service and
//!    every other one handed the same documents answer alike: an explicit `Deny` wins,
//!    otherwise an `Allow` about the request grants it, and with neither the request falls
//!    to IAM's default deny.
//!
//! Only the store LOOKUPS live here; neither the decision nor the wording of the refusal
//! does. That is the split every other gate in this tree makes
//! (`services/service-com-amazonaws-appsync-awsdeepdishcontrolplaneservice/src/service/authorization.rs`
//! and
//! `services/service-com-amazonaws-marketplacediscovery-awsmarketplacediscovery/src/service/authorization.rs`),
//! and the lookups stay in this crate for the reason those keep theirs there: hoisting
//! them into `service-common` would make every service depending on that crate link the
//! IAM and STS service crates.
//!
//! ## The action and the resource
//!
//! The action is `guardduty:<OperationName>` — this service's `arnNamespace`, which is
//! also its signing name ([`ACTION_PREFIX`]) — so one policy statement scoped to this
//! service's actions covers every operation of it and nothing outside it.
//!
//! The resource is the ARN of what the REQUEST ADDRESSES, spelled the way this service's
//! own ARN builders spell it and read off the request line:
//!
//! * the tagging surface binds its target's whole ARN as its one path label
//!   (`/tags/{ResourceArn}` — `smithy_query(operation="TagResource")`), so that ARN is
//!   already the resource;
//! * a detector and everything under it, and one Malware Protection plan, are addressed by
//!   paths that ARE the resource paths this service's ARNs carry — so
//!   `/detector/{DetectorId}/ipset/{IpSetId}` is judged against the `ipset` resource and
//!   `/malware-protection-plan/{MalwareProtectionPlanId}` against the plan's own ARN
//!   ([`crate::state::malware_protection_plan_arn`] builds exactly that);
//! * one association of a custom detection rule has an ARN whose resource path is NOT its
//!   URI path, so it is built by the one function that builds it
//!   ([`crate::state::custom_detection_rule_association_arn`]);
//! * a request that addresses no single resource of this account in this Region — a
//!   collection, and the whole published-rule catalogue, whose rules are AWS-MANAGED so
//!   that their ARNs carry neither this account nor this Region
//!   ([`crate::state::custom_detection_rule_arn`]) — is judged against every resource of
//!   this service in the account and Region addressed ([`ANY_RESOURCE`]), which is how IAM
//!   writes the resource of such a request.
//!
//! Taking the identifiers from the REQUEST rather than from a stored record is also what
//! keeps a refused call from telling an unauthorized caller whether what it named exists.
//!
//! This service publishes no resource-based policy of its own — the model declares no
//! policy operation and no policy member — so the decision here is the identity-based one
//! alone.
//!
//! ## The callers this gate does not bound
//!
//! * **The account's own published credential.** A request whose access key id neither STS
//!   nor IAM holds a record for resolves to the account's own identity, which is not a
//!   principal the IAM store holds policies for — the position AWS account root
//!   credentials are in. Such a request is allowed.
//! * **A principal holding an attachment this emulator cannot read.** An AWS-managed
//!   policy belongs to AWS rather than to this account, so the IAM store holds no document
//!   for it; refusing on a grant this emulator cannot see would deny access AWS permits.
//!   An explicit `Deny` in a document that CAN be read still refuses, and a permissions
//!   boundary the store DOES hold still caps the grant.
//! * **An engine carrying no STS or IAM store**, where no session and no user can exist.
//!
//! An expired session credential speaks for nobody: it carries no documents and no
//! principal spelling, so every action it asks for is refused. (A session the
//! authenticating layer has already refused never reaches a handler at all.)
