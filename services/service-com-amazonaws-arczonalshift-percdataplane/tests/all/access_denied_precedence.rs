//! Authorization precedence on a zonal-shift mutation's target.
//!
//! The rule under test, asserted over a TABLE of targets rather than one request:
//! an operation that acts on a target it names (`StartZonalShift` by
//! `resourceIdentifier`, `CancelZonalShift` and `UpdateZonalShift` by
//! `zonalShiftId`) has the caller's authorization on that target decided BEFORE the
//! target is resolved, so an identifier ARC holds nothing for is refused with
//! `AccessDeniedException` — `@error client`, `@httpError 403`, a service-common
//! error of `PercDataPlane` — and the refusal discloses nothing about whether the
//! identifier names anything (never `ResourceNotFoundException`, 404).
//!
//! What such a refusal STATES depends on what the call named: a denial taken on a
//! `resourceIdentifier` states ARC's reason about that resource, and a denial taken on a
//! `zonalShiftId` — which is not a resource an IAM policy grants an action on, so there
//! is no resolved target to report about — states no reason at all, the model's
//! `AccessDeniedException$message` being optional. That rule is the subject of
//! `refusal_disclosure.rs`; here it is one assertion per row.
//!
//! The rows differ in the FORM and the SIZE of the identifier (ARN and non-ARN,
//! other account, other Region, each end of the modelled length range, letters,
//! digits and hyphens) and in the request payload carried with it, so what is
//! pinned is the branch and not one recorded value. The boundary case is here too:
//! a target the store DOES hold is authorized, so the same operations proceed —
//! the refusal is computed from the store, not returned unconditionally.
//!
//! The same ordering decides the branch a REPORTING operation on a named target
//! takes, which is where the two refusals separate: `GetManagedResource` can only be
//! authorized on an identifier shaped like a resource ARN (`ResourceArn`'s
//! `@pattern`, `^arn:.*$`), because that is what an IAM policy grants an ARC action
//! on, so an identifier that is not ARN-shaped is denied 403 before the store is
//! consulted, while an ARN-shaped identifier ARC holds no record of is resolved and
//! reported as `ResourceNotFoundException` (404).
