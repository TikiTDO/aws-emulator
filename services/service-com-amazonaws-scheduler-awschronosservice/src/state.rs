//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-scheduler-awschronosservice service.
//!
//! EventBridge Scheduler's control plane is two nested resources: a
//! `ScheduleGroup` (named, holds tags) and the `Schedule`s inside it. Both live
//! here, keyed so the ordered maps enumerate deterministically — which is what
//! lets `ListSchedules` resume from an opaque page token.
//!
//! The rules a schedule's own definition has to satisfy — its expression, the
//! zone that expression is read in, and the window its instants bound — live in
//! [`schedule_definition`] and are re-exported here, so both operations that
//! write a schedule reach them the way they reach the rest of this module.
//!
//! What the control plane persists is only half of this service: a schedule is
//! also INVOKED. Which instants one runs at lives in [`occurrence`], and the clock
//! that performs them — and the hand-over that reaches each target — in
//! [`invocation`], which the operations that write a schedule arm. What becomes of
//! an invocation that did not reach its target — the attempts its retry policy
//! admits, and the dead-letter route the last of them takes — is [`dead_letter`].
