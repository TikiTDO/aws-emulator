//! What one occurrence hands its target is the INVOKING schedule's own
//! `Target.Input` — end to end over the wire through the real `MultiServiceRouter`,
//! with the services a schedule's target lives in and IAM mounted beside EventBridge
//! Scheduler on ONE engine, so the payload is asserted where the target sees it.
//!
//! RULE: `Target$Input` — "the text, or well-formed JSON, passed to the target" —
//! belongs to the ONE schedule record that carries it, which the store addresses by
//! its group and its name, so every occurrence hands its target the `Input` of the
//! schedule the occurrence belongs to, verbatim, however many other schedules name
//! the SAME target; and an occurrence whose `Target$RoleArn` does not allow the call
//! the target is invoked by does not invoke the target at all, so no schedule's
//! `Input` is ever observable at another schedule's target.
//!
//! The rows span the class rather than one recorded case: they differ along the FORM
//! of the `Input` (a nested document carrying arrays, mixed number types, booleans,
//! null, non-ASCII text and embedded quotes; a flat object; the empty object; a
//! top-level array; text that is not JSON at all), along the GROUP the schedule lives
//! in — including two schedules of the same NAME in different groups, which is the
//! pair the store keys a record by — and along whether the schedule's execution role
//! allows the invocation.
//!
//! The first suite below invokes a QUEUE target, where the delivered payload is the
//! message body a client reads. The second invokes a FUNCTION target, which is the
//! shape a client fans several schedules into one handler with: the payload is
//! asserted in the asynchronous invocation Lambda holds for the function.
