//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-mediapackagev2-mediapackagev2 service.
//!
//! MediaPackage v2 is a three-level containment hierarchy — channel group -> channel
//! -> origin endpoint — so the store nests the same way: a channel cannot exist
//! without its group, and deleting a parent that still has children is refused wherever
//! the model declares `ConflictException` for that delete — the group's and the channel's.
//! The origin endpoint's delete declares none, so it is unconditional: it takes the
//! records persisted ON the endpoint (its policy, its harvest jobs) with it. Every
//! derived value a response carries (ARN, egress domain, ingest URL, manifest URL,
//! ETag, timestamps) is computed by the call that WRITES the record - a create, or an
//! update - and persisted, so every later read reproduces it byte for byte and no
//! response computes a value of its own while being serialized. A resource's `ETag` is a
//! function of its content and of the commit count the store holds it at (see
//! [`ChannelGroup::version`]), so a write that changed the resource rotates it.
//!
//! MediaPackage v2 is a REGIONAL control plane, so the Region a request is served in is
//! part of the identity of every resource it touches: a channel group is stored under
//! its Region AND its name ([`ChannelGroupKey`]), the same name in two Regions is two
//! independent groups with their own channels, endpoints and harvest jobs, and a request
//! served in one Region resolves, lists, mutates and deletes only what was created in
//! it. Every accessor on the store therefore takes the request's Region
//! ([`request_region`]) beside the name.
//!
//! The maps are [`BTreeMap`]s: `ListOriginEndpoints` pages in name order, and an
//! ordered map makes that order a property of the store rather than of each read.
//!
//! The same holds for the members the SERVICE applies rather than the caller: a channel's
//! input type and output locking mode, its switching and CMSD-header blocks, an origin
//! endpoint's segment settings, startover window and URI/stream-name modes, and every
//! manifest configuration's window, URI path type, child-manifest URL encoding and (on
//! the HLS families) child manifest name are materialised ONCE, at create time, from the
//! submitted value or the service's default, and stored — so the create response, a later
//! read and the list projection all report the same concrete value.
