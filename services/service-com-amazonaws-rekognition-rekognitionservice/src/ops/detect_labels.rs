//! @op DetectLabels
//!
//! ## What this handler does
//!
//! `DetectLabels` answers with what the submitted image CARRIES, and with nothing else: the
//! image's bytes are the request's own inline `Bytes` or the object this emulator's Amazon
//! S3 holds at the `S3Object` it named ([`crate::state::image_source`]), and both the
//! entities and colours reported in `Labels` and the pixel measurements reported in
//! `ImageProperties` are measured off the decoded frame by
//! [`crate::state::label_detection`]. An image carrying nothing this process can measure is
//! answered with an EMPTY `Labels` list, which is what was measured; a refusal is reserved
//! for an image this service could not read at all, one modelled error per reason.
//!
//! `Features` selects the two analyses, and a request naming none asks for `GENERAL_LABELS`
//! — "if no option is specified GENERAL_LABELS is used by default". `ImageProperties` is
//! reported only for a request that asked for `IMAGE_PROPERTIES`, and `LabelModelVersion`
//! only where label detection ran, that member being "the label detection model that was
//! used to detect labels".
//!
//! `MaxLabels`, `MinConfidence` and `Settings.GeneralLabels` NARROW the labels measured, in
//! the order the documentation puts them: the filters select which labels may be reported,
//! `MinConfidence` drops every label below the floor (55 percent where the request names
//! none), and `MaxLabels` keeps the highest-confidence labels of what is left. All three
//! "are only valid when supplying GENERAL_LABELS as a feature type", so for a request that
//! asked only for image properties there is no label to narrow.
//!
//! It PERSISTS NOTHING and reads no stored resource: the whole answer is a function of the
//! submitted image, so this service's own store is neither read nor written here and two
//! identical calls answer identically without either having changed anything.
//!
//! `OrientationCorrection` is absent because the member's own documentation says it is:
//! "the value of OrientationCorrection is always null".
//!

//!
//! # Modeled contract for `DetectLabels`
//!
//! What AWS documents for this operation, from this service's Smithy model. HTML is
//! stripped and long entries are clipped at ` …`. For the FULL text of any one item,
//! ask the model rather than reading the raw JSON:
//!
//! ```text
//! smithy_query(query="doc",shape="<Shape>",member="<Member>",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-rekognition-rekognitionservice/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-rekognition-rekognitionservice.json")
//! ```
//!
//! Detects instances of real-world entities within an image (JPEG or PNG) provided as
//! input. This includes objects like flower, tree, and table; events like wedding,
//! graduation, and birthday party; and concepts like landscape, evening, and nature. For an
//! example, see Analyzing images stored in an Amazon S3 bucket in the Amazon Rekognition
//! Developer Guide. You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a
//! reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket. If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon
//! Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not supported. The image must be either a
//! PNG or JPEG formatted file. Optional Parameters You can specify one or both of the
//! GENERAL_LABELS and IMAGE_PROPERTIES feature types when calling the DetectLabels API.
//! Including GENERAL_LABELS will ensure the response includes the labels detected in the
//! input image, while including IMAGE_PROPERTIES will ensure the response includes
//! information about the image quality and color. When using GENERAL_LABELS and/or
//! IMAGE_PROPERTIES you can provide filtering criteria to the Settings parameter. You can
//! filter with sets of individual labels or with label categories. You can specify
//! inclusive filters, exclusive filters, or a combination of inclusive and exclusive
//! filters. For more information on filtering see Detecting Labels in an Image. When
//! getting labels, you can specify MinConfidence to control the confidence threshold for
//! the labels returned. The default is 55%. You can also add the MaxLabels parameter to
//! limit the number of labels returned. The default and upper limit is 1000 labels. These
//! arguments are only valid when supplying GENERAL_LABELS as a feature type. Response
//! Elements For each object, scene, and concept the API returns one or more labels. The API
//! returns the following types of information about labels: Name - The name of the detected
//! label. Confidence - The level of confidence in the label assigned to a detected object.
//! Parents - The ancestor labels for a detected label. DetectLabels returns a hierarchical
//! taxonomy of detected labels. For example, a detected car might be assigned the label
//! car. The label car has two parent labels: Vehicle (its parent) and Transportation (its
//! grandparent). The response includes the all ancestors for a label, where every ancestor
//! is a unique label. In the previous example, Car, Vehicle, and Transportation are
//! returned as unique labels in the response. Aliases - Possible Aliases for the label.
//! Categories - The label categories that the detected label belongs to. BoundingBox —
//! Bounding boxes are described for all instances of detected common object labels,
//! returned in an array of Instance objects. An Instance object contains a BoundingBox
//! object, describing the location of the label on the input image. It also includes the
//! confidence for the accuracy of the detected bounding box. The API returns the following
//! information regarding the image, as part of the ImageProperties structure: Quality -
//! Information about the Sharpness, …
//!
//! ## Input
//!
//! * `Features` (DetectLabelsFeatureList, len 0..2) — A list of the types of analysis to
//!   perform. Specifying GENERAL_LABELS uses the label detection feature, while specifying
//!   IMAGE_PROPERTIES returns information regarding image color and quality. If no option is
//!   specified GENERAL_LABELS is used by default.
//! * `Image` (Image) **required** — The input image as base64-encoded bytes or an S3 object.
//!   If you use the AWS CLI to call Amazon Rekognition operations, passing image bytes is not
//!   supported. Images stored in an S3 Bucket do not need to be base64-encoded. If you are
//!   using an AWS SDK to call Amazon Rekognition, you might not need to base64-encode image
//!   bytes passed using the Bytes field. For more information, see Images in the Amazon
//!   Rekognition developer guide.
//! * `MaxLabels` (UInteger, range 0..) — Maximum number of labels you want the service to
//!   return in the response. The service returns the specified number of highest confidence
//!   labels. Only valid when GENERAL_LABELS is specified as a feature type in the Feature
//!   input parameter.
//! * `MinConfidence` (Percent, range 0..100) — Specifies the minimum confidence level for the
//!   labels to return. Amazon Rekognition doesn't return any labels with confidence lower
//!   than this specified value. If MinConfidence is not specified, the operation returns
//!   labels with a confidence values greater than or equal to 55 percent. Only valid when
//!   GENERAL_LABELS is specified as a feature type in the Feature input parameter.
//! * `Settings` (DetectLabelsSettings) — A list of the filters to be applied to returned
//!   detected labels and image properties. Specified filters can be inclusive, exclusive, or
//!   a combination of both. Filters can be used for individual labels or label categories.
//!   The exact label names or label categories must be supplied. For a full list of labels
//!   and label categories, see Detecting labels.
//!
//! ## Output
//!
//! * `ImageProperties` (DetectLabelsImageProperties) — Information about the properties of
//!   the input image, such as brightness, sharpness, contrast, and dominant colors.
//! * `LabelModelVersion` (String) — Version number of the label detection model that was used
//!   to detect labels.
//! * `Labels` (Labels) — An array of labels for the real-world objects detected.
//! * `OrientationCorrection` (OrientationCorrection, one of: ROTATE_0 | ROTATE_180 |
//!   ROTATE_270 | ROTATE_90) — The value of OrientationCorrection is always null. If the
//!   input image is in .jpeg format, it might contain exchangeable image file format (Exif)
//!   metadata that includes the image's orientation. Amazon Rekognition uses this orientation
//!   information to perform image correction. The bounding box coordinates are translated to
//!   represent object locations after the orientation information in the Exif metadata is
//!   used to correct the image orientation. Images in .png format don't contain Exif
//!   metadata. Amazon Rekognition doesn’t perform image correction for images in .png format
//!   and .jpeg images without orientation information in the image Exif metadata. The
//!   bounding box coordinates aren't translated …
//!
//! ## Errors
//!
//! * `AccessDeniedException` (HTTP 400) — You are not authorized to perform the action.
//! * `ImageTooLargeException` (HTTP 400) — The input image size exceeds the allowed limit. If
//!   you are calling DetectProtectiveEquipment, the image size or resolution exceeds the
//!   allowed limit. For more information, see Guidelines and quotas in Amazon Rekognition in
//!   the Amazon Rekognition Developer Guide.
//! * `InternalServerError` (HTTP 500) — Amazon Rekognition experienced a service issue. Try
//!   your call again.
//! * `InvalidImageFormatException` (HTTP 400) — The provided image format is not supported.
//! * `InvalidParameterException` (HTTP 400) — Input parameter violated a constraint. Validate
//!   your parameter before calling the API operation again.
//! * `InvalidS3ObjectException` (HTTP 400) — Amazon Rekognition is unable to access the S3
//!   object specified in the request.
//! * `ProvisionedThroughputExceededException` (HTTP 400) — The number of requests exceeded
//!   your throughput limit. If you want to increase this limit, contact Amazon Rekognition.
//! * `ThrottlingException` (HTTP 500) — Amazon Rekognition is temporarily unable to process
//!   the request. Try your call again.
