//! The media types this service's responses are announced under — there are two.
//!
//! # What the wire shows
//!
//! The model declares `aws.protocols#awsJson1_0`
//! (`smithy_query(query="service_info",model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-bcmpricingcalculator-awsbcmpricingcalculator/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-bcmpricingcalculator-awsbcmpricingcalculator.json")`),
//! which implies `application/x-amz-json-1.0`, and the framework's renderers stamp exactly
//! that. The recorded wire shows that value on some of this service's responses and
//! `application/x-amz-json-1.1` on others, and the split is visible INSIDE one recorded
//! session rather than across sessions: in one fixture the create of a workload estimate is
//! recorded under `1.1` while the tag listing, tag write and tag removal of that same
//! estimate are recorded under `1.0`, and in another the refusal of a name outside its
//! `@pattern` is recorded under `1.0` while the not-found answers of the reads beside it are
//! recorded under `1.1`. So this service answers through two announcers:
//!
//! * the WORKLOAD-ESTIMATE, BILL-SCENARIO, BILL-ESTIMATE and PREFERENCES operations are
//!   fronted by a dispatcher announcing `application/x-amz-json-1.1` on what it returns —
//!   their successes, and the errors their handlers raise about stored state (a resource
//!   that does not exist, a quota that is spent);
//! * a refusal that reports the REQUEST ITSELF as invalid — a member outside the constraint
//!   its shape declares — is answered by the request validator in front of that dispatcher,
//!   and announces the protocol-implied `application/x-amz-json-1.0`. So do the other
//!   responses rendered in front of it: an unroutable request, a transport-level failure,
//!   the authentication refusal;
//! * the RESOURCE-TAGGING operations announce the protocol-implied media type throughout,
//!   on every status.
//!
//! The two announcers are told apart by WHICH refusal a response is, not by the shape it is
//! worded in: this service answers an input-constraint violation and a refusal of a
//! WELL-FORMED request from a member account in the one modelled `ValidationException`
//! (`crate::state::...::member_account_refusal`), and the recorded wire announces the first
//! under the protocol-implied media type and the second under the dispatcher's — the
//! account-class gate is part of the dispatcher's front door, which is also what its
//! `reason` says (`INVALID_REQUEST_FROM_MEMBER`, where a constraint refusal reports
//! `fieldValidationFailed`). So the question below is asked of the GROUND the refusal states
//! and not of its `__type`.
//!
//! Which layer renders a refusal about the request is the EMULATOR's business and does not
//! change what it announces: the boundary validator refuses what the model's constraints
//! express and a handler refuses what they cannot (a reserved tag key, a retention instant
//! already past), so the predicate below reads the refusal the client receives rather than
//! the seam that produced it.
//!
//! The two lists are therefore read on different things, and each on what the wire record
//! shows: the tagging family is a fact of the OPERATION, so it is read off the routing key
//! before the walk runs, while the validator's refusal is a fact of the RESPONSE. The
//! responses rendered outside the walk — an unroutable request, a transport-level failure,
//! the authentication refusal — reach neither list: no operation of this service ran, so
//! they keep what their own renderer stamped, which is the protocol-implied value. A failure
//! the framework renders INSIDE the walk of an operation the dispatcher fronts and that is
//! not a modelled constraint refusal (a body the codec cannot read) is announced as the
//! dispatcher's, because the recorded wire shows no such response under the other value.
//!
//! The REQUEST side is untouched by all of it: the media type a caller sends is never
//! re-read, requests still route by `X-Amz-Target: AWSBCMPricingCalculator.<Operation>`, and
//! the awsJson `1.0` and `1.1` codecs are the same `JsonCodec` over the same body, so a call
//! sent under either one reads byte for byte.
//!
//! # Where the rule lives
//!
//! Not here. The mechanism — the one function that re-announces a response
//! ([`ResponseMediaType::announce`]), the predicate type a service states its announcers
//! with, the operation-seam wrapper that carries both around the centralized walk
//! ([`ResponseMediaTypeOperation`](service_common::response_media_type::ResponseMediaTypeOperation))
//! and the question "is this response the request validator's?"
//! ([`service_common::response_media_type::not_an_input_validation_refusal`]) — is
//! [`service_common::response_media_type`], the tree's one statement of it. This module
//! holds only what is this SERVICE's: the pair its dispatcher announces across and which
//! operations that dispatcher fronts, named once so every seam in [`crate::service`] reads
//! the same values. `tests/all/response_media_type.rs` pins both announcers over the wire.
