//! `UpdateTopic`, driven end to end over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! emulator serves from, through the shared harness in
//! `tests/all/kafka_harness.rs`.
//!
//! RULE under test: a change to a topic of a provisioned cluster is applied to
//! the record every later reader answers from — the partition count the request
//! names and the topic-level `Configs` it submits — and it is accepted only for a
//! topic that cluster HOLDS and that is in a state a change is accepted from, with
//! a count that GROWS: Apache Kafka adds partitions to a topic and never takes
//! them away, so a count below the topic's own, or the one it already has, is
//! refused and changes nothing. An accepted change makes the topic `UPDATING`
//! until the clock owes it `ACTIVE` again, and the new partitions are the topic's
//! from the instant the call is accepted. Two concurrent increases of one topic
//! admit exactly one winner.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which members the request
//! carries (count alone, configs alone, both), the size and direction of the
//! count change, whether the topic already carried a configuration, the topic
//! name's form, and the state the topic is in when the call arrives.
