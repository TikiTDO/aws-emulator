//! The topic lifecycle of a provisioned cluster (`CreateTopic`, `DescribeTopic`,
//! `DeleteTopic`), driven end to end over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! emulator serves from.
//!
//! Each suite asserts a RULE over a table of inputs rather than one recorded
//! request: the rows differ along whatever the rule generalises over (topic name
//! form and length, partition count, replication factor, `Configs` presence,
//! broker count, which topic of a set is addressed, which way an ARN is
//! malformed, signing region). Where the rule is an invariant — a created topic
//! reading back exactly as created, a delete being visible to every later reader,
//! a refusal leaving the registry alone — the input space is walked exhaustively.
//!
//! The router, the `Reply` wrapper, the percent-encoder and the `CreateCluster`
//! request builder come from [`crate::kafka_harness`], the crate's shared
//! harness; only the topic calls and the topic table row live here.
