//! The Apache Kafka version catalog as the service PUBLISHES it, driven end to
//! end over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the emulator serves from (the shared
//! harness in `tests/all/kafka_harness.rs`).
//!
//! Three rules, each asserted from the WIRE alone — the expectations are computed
//! from what `ListKafkaVersions` reported, never from the service's own catalog
//! constant, so a second, drifting table would fail here (the version-spelling
//! helpers are the shared harness's, so no suite disagrees with its neighbour
//! about what `3.9.x.kraft` names):
//!
//! * the listing serves one entry per published ROW, so a page resumes after a
//!   row — checked at EVERY page boundary, which is exhaustive over the
//!   boundaries a walk can stop at;
//! * a version the catalog publishes an `ACTIVE` row for is a version the
//!   service still offers, on every surface that answers about a version: the
//!   upgrade matrix's targets and the valid-value list a create refusal carries;
//! * the crossing from ZooKeeper mode to the KRaft line is offered at ONE
//!   release, the final offered ZooKeeper-mode release — checked over every
//!   ZooKeeper-mode version the catalog publishes.
