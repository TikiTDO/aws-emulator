//! `UpdateClusterKafkaVersion` end to end, over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! emulator serves from, through the harness in `tests/all/kafka_harness.rs`.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. an accepted update is applied ASYNCHRONOUSLY: it records a cluster
//!    operation of the Apache Kafka version type, leaves the cluster `UPDATING`
//!    with that operation as its `ActiveOperationArn`, and lands the target
//!    version plus a new `CurrentVersion` only once the clock owes the operation
//!    its completion — every other member of the cluster untouched;
//! 2. `TargetKafkaVersion` must be one of the versions the cluster's version can
//!    be updated to: catalogued, still offered, and strictly newer. Anything else
//!    is refused `BadRequestException` and the cluster is left exactly as it was;
//! 3. the cluster the URI names is resolved before the body: an ARN this region
//!    holds no cluster for is a `NotFoundException` whatever the body asks for,
//!    and a malformed one a `BadRequestException`;
//! 4. the submitted `CurrentVersion` must be the one the cluster is at, the
//!    cluster must be `ACTIVE`, and a serverless cluster has no Apache Kafka
//!    version to update;
//! 5. a `ConfigurationInfo` the request names is applied with the new version and
//!    must resolve to a revision this region holds.
//!
//! The rows differ along what each rule generalises over: the spelling of a
//! version (three components, a fourth, a qualifier, a `.x` minor), the size and
//! direction of the move, the support status of source and target, the kind of
//! ARN, the kind of stale version, the cluster state and kind, and how many
//! revisions the named configuration holds.
