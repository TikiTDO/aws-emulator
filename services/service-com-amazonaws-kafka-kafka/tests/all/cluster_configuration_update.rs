//! `UpdateClusterConfiguration` end to end, over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the
//! emulator serves from, through the harness in `tests/all/kafka_harness.rs`.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE rather than one request:
//!
//! 1. an accepted update is applied ASYNCHRONOUSLY: it records a cluster
//!    operation of the cluster-configuration type, leaves the cluster `UPDATING`
//!    with that operation as its `ActiveOperationArn` and still its previous
//!    configuration, and lands the named revision plus a new `CurrentVersion`
//!    only once the clock owes the operation its completion — every other member
//!    of the cluster untouched;
//! 2. the `ConfigurationInfo` must resolve to a revision this endpoint's region
//!    holds, otherwise the call is the configuration family's one
//!    unresolvable-reference refusal and the cluster is left exactly as it was;
//! 3. the cluster the URI names is resolved before the body: an ARN this region
//!    holds no cluster for is a `NotFoundException` whatever the body asks for,
//!    and an ARN that is not a cluster ARN at all a `BadRequestException`;
//! 4. the submitted `CurrentVersion` must be the one the cluster is at, the
//!    cluster must be `ACTIVE`, and a serverless cluster has no broker
//!    configuration of its own to update.
//!
//! The rows differ along what each rule generalises over: which revision of a
//! configuration is applied (its first, a middle one, its latest), which
//! configuration it is and what its properties hold, whether the cluster already
//! runs one, the kind of unresolvable reference, the kind of ARN, the kind of
//! stale version, and the cluster's state and kind.
