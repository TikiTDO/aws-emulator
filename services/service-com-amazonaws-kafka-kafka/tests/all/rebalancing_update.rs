//! `UpdateRebalancing`, driven end to end over the same `MultiServiceRouter` the

//! `tests/all/kafka_harness.rs`.
//!
//! RULE under test: an update of a provisioned cluster's intelligent-rebalancing
//! status is accepted only for a cluster this endpoint's region holds that is in a
//! state a change is accepted from and whose stored version is the one the request
//! names, and it is applied asynchronously — the call hands back a
//! cluster-operation ARN and the cluster enters `UPDATING` with that operation as
//! its active one, keeping its old status and version; once the clock makes the
//! operation due the submitted status is the cluster's own, every reader reports
//! it, and the cluster gets a new version and returns to `ACTIVE`. A refused call
//! changes nothing.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: which status the request
//! names, the status the cluster starts from (including a cluster created without
//! the setting at all), and the broker category the cluster runs — the setting is
//! the cluster's whichever of them it was created with.
