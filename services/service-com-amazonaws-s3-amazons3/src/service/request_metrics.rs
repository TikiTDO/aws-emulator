//! The `AWS/S3` REQUEST metrics this service publishes about the requests it serves on a
//! bucket whose client asked for them.
//!
//! # What a request metric is
//!
//! S3 publishes request metrics for a bucket only where a client has asked for them, by
//! storing a metrics configuration on it (`PutBucketMetricsConfiguration`: "Sets a metrics
//! configuration (specified by the metrics configuration ID) for the bucket"). Each
//! configuration is its OWN series: the datapoints are dimensioned by the bucket the request
//! addressed ([`BUCKET_NAME_DIMENSION`]) and by the id of the configuration the request fell
//! under ([`FILTER_ID_DIMENSION`]) — "this dimension filters metrics configurations that you
//! specify for request metrics on a bucket, for example, a prefix, tag, or access point"
//! (Amazon S3 User Guide, *Metrics and dimensions*) — so a bucket carrying two
//! configurations has two series of every metric below, and a bucket carrying none has no
//! series at all.
//!
//! WHICH configurations one request falls under is each configuration's `Filter`
//! ([`matches`]): a configuration with no filter covers the whole bucket, and a filtered one
//! covers the requests whose addressed object the filter selects.
//!
//! # What each request contributes
//!
//! Every request counted contributes ONE observation to each series below, which is what
//! makes a period that had requests carry a datapoint of every one of them rather than only
//! of the ones that happened to be non-zero (Amazon S3 User Guide, *Amazon S3 CloudWatch
//! request metrics*, from which each definition below is quoted):
//!
//! * [`ALL_REQUESTS`] — "the total number of HTTP requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket,
//!   regardless of type": one per request;
//! * the counter of the request's own TYPE — [`GET_REQUESTS`] ("the number of HTTP GET
//!   requests made for objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. This doesn't include list
//!   operations"), [`PUT_REQUESTS`], [`DELETE_REQUESTS`], [`HEAD_REQUESTS`],
//!   [`POST_REQUESTS`] or [`LIST_REQUESTS`] ("the number of HTTP requests that list the
//!   contents of a bucket") — one per request of that type, which is what
//!   [`RequestKind::counter`] names;
//! * [`FOUR_XX_ERRORS`] and [`FIVE_XX_ERRORS`] — "the number of HTTP 4xx client error status
//!   code requests made to an Amazon S3 bucket with a value of either 0 or 1", and the same
//!   for the 5xx class: one observation per request, 1 when that request's own answer carried
//!   a status of the class and 0 when it did not, so the `Sum` over a period is how many
//!   requests of that period failed that way and the `Average` is the rate. A request that
//!   was SERVED therefore publishes a zero-valued error datapoint, which is what tells a
//!   client watching a quiet prefix from one watching a bucket that reports nothing;
//! * [`BYTES_DOWNLOADED`] — "the number of bytes downloaded for requests made to an Amazon S3
//!   bucket, where the response includes a body" — and [`BYTES_UPLOADED`] — "the number of
//!   bytes uploaded that contain a request body, made to an Amazon S3 bucket": observed only
//!   for a request that carried a body in that direction, because that is the request each
//!   definition counts.
//! * [`FIRST_BYTE_LATENCY`] — "the per-request time from the complete request being received by
//!   an Amazon S3 bucket to when the response starts to be returned" — and
//!   [`TOTAL_REQUEST_LATENCY`] — "the elapsed per-request time from the first byte received to
//!   the last byte sent to an Amazon S3 bucket", which "includes the time taken to receive the
//!   request body and send the response body": one observation each, in `Milliseconds`, of the
//!   spans [`RequestClock`] MEASURED while this service served that one request. Every request
//!   takes time to serve, so every counted request observes both, which is what makes a
//!   client's `Average`/`Maximum` over a period the latency of the requests that period really
//!   carried.
//!
//! # Where the datapoints go
//!
//! Into the CloudWatch emulator's OWN metric store — the same store `ListMetrics`,
//! `GetMetricStatistics` and the alarm evaluation read — reached through the shared engine, so
//! one metric has one home and the publisher and its readers cannot drift. They never travel
//! over `PutMetricData`, which refuses a publish into a namespace the services own ("you
//! should not specify a namespace that begins with `AWS/`", `PutMetricDataInput$Namespace`).
//!
//! # How a request reaches here
//!
//! [`Metered`] wraps the operation: the request is served exactly as before and the answer is
//! counted afterwards, so the status, the response body and the request body counted are the
//! ones the caller really got and sent — a refusal the framework's own walk made included.
//! [`serve_metered`] is the table of which operations are wrapped.
//!
//! What that leaves out is a request the framework refused BEFORE it named an operation — one
//! whose signature the emulator did not verify, or whose address names no operation at all:
//! those are answered ahead of any operation, so no operation of this service sees them and
//! none counts them.
//!
//! What one request's fold costs is bounded by the bucket's own configuration count, which
//! this service's store caps at
//! [`crate::state::MAX_METRICS_CONFIGURATIONS_PER_BUCKET`] — the published "up to 1,000
//! metrics configurations per bucket" — times the fixed number of series above; and each
//! append is bounded in turn by the metric store's own per-series and series-count caps.
