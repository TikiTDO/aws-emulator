//! End-to-end tests for four rules of S3's bucket sub-resource and listing planes, each
//! driven as a real HTTP request through the router so what is pinned is the wire behaviour
//! — status, error code, message and what a later read reports — rather than any handler's
//! internals.
//!
//! The rules under test, with their sources:
//!
//! * A `Deleted` entry of a multi-object delete reports the version it removed AND, when
//!   that version WAS a delete marker, that marker's own id: `DeletedObject$DeleteMarker`
//!   "indicates whether the specified object version that was permanently deleted was
//!   (true) or was not (false) a delete marker before deletion", and
//!   `DeletedObject$DeleteMarkerVersionId` is "the version ID of the delete marker".
//! * A `Delete` payload outside the published bound — "the request can contain a list of up
//!   to 1,000 keys" (`DeleteObjects`' own documentation), and the container carries at least
//!   one `Object` — is refused `MalformedXML`, which carries that code's own FIXED published
//!   sentence and nothing appended to it.
//! * With a delimiter, a listing's start token names an ENTRY of the listing — a key or a
//!   common prefix — and the listing resumes after that whole entry: "CommonPrefixes is
//!   filtered out from results if it is not lexicographically greater than the key-marker"
//!   (`ListObjectsRequest$Delimiter`), the same token `ListObjectsV2Request$StartAfter` is.
//! * A bucket-configuration `continuation-token` is "an opaque value that Amazon S3
//!   understands" and is scoped to the listing it was issued for AND to the bucket it was
//!   issued over, so a value S3 never issued names no page at all and one issued over
//!   another bucket names no page of this one.
//! * A lifecycle rule whose actions cannot be scoped the way its filter asks, or whose
//!   filter names a predicate that is not one, is refused with the code and the sentence S3
//!   publishes for the rule it broke rather than stored.
