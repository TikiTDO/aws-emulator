//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-ram-amazonresourcesharing service.
//!
//! The service's primary resource is the **resource share**. Every share is stored
//! exactly once, keyed by its ARN (`arn:aws:ram:<region>:<account>:resource-share/<id>`),
//! and every association between a share and an entity — a resource, a principal or
//! a source — is stored exactly once beside it, keyed by
//! `(share arn, association type, associated entity)`. Each operation reads and
//! writes those two maps, so what a create or an update stored is exactly what a
//! later read reports.
//!
//! Both maps are `BTreeMap`s: the key order is total and stable, so a paginated read
//! can name the next entry in an opaque `nextToken` and a page boundary survives
//! later writes.
//!
//! Sharing with a principal outside the owning account's organization also stores an
//! **invitation**, keyed by its own ARN, beside the share: the invited account joins
//! the share only once it answers, so what is pending for it is a record of its own.
//!
//! Managed permissions are kept in one map too, and a fresh store already holds the
//! AWS managed permissions RAM ships ([`aws_managed_permissions`]): those exist before
//! any caller creates anything, so the permissions one account created and the ones
//! Amazon Web Services maintains are read back through the same lookup.
