//! The RUN of a FHIR import job: reading the FHIR data the request's
//! `InputDataConfig` names and DELIVERING each resource it holds into the data
//! store the job imports into.
//!
//! `StartFHIRImportJob` is documented as importing "bulk FHIR data into an ACTIVE
//! data store" from "the InputDataConfig object", whose one member is an
//! `S3Uri` — "the user-specified Amazon S3 location of the FHIR data to be
//! imported into HealthLake". So an import is not a label on a job record: the
//! resources it reads are resources the data store HOLDS afterwards, served by
//! its FHIR REST data plane ([`crate::service::fhir_rest`]) exactly as it serves
//! one a caller created through the endpoint.
//!
//! # Where the data comes from
//!
//! This emulator holds an Amazon S3 of its own, and it is reached the way any
//! emulated service reaches another: the operation callback
//! ([`smithy_server_runtime::OperationContext::callback`]), which routes IN
//! PROCESS — no socket, no outbound request, no host resolution, and no address
//! a caller supplies is ever dialled. An object a caller staged with `PutObject`
//! is therefore the object an import job reads.
//!
//! HOW MUCH IS READ IS BOUNDED, four ways, each checked before the bytes are
//! taken into this process where the listing declares them: how many objects one
//! job reads ([`MAX_IMPORT_OBJECTS`]), how large one object may be
//! ([`MAX_IMPORT_OBJECT_BYTES`]), how many bytes one job reads in total
//! ([`MAX_IMPORT_TOTAL_BYTES`]) and how many resources one job imports
//! ([`MAX_IMPORT_RESOURCES`]) — so no product of caller-chosen factors is the
//! bound.
//!
//! # What the input holds
//!
//! The bulk form HealthLake documents for import is newline-delimited FHIR JSON:
//! one resource per line. A file that is instead ONE JSON document — a single
//! resource, or an array of them — is read as that document, because that is
//! what the bytes are; nothing here keys off a file name or an extension. The
//! JSON itself is read by `serde_json`, never by hand.
//!
//! A file holding no FHIR resource at all is a scanned NON-FHIR file, and a line
//! that is not a FHIR resource — unreadable JSON, a JSON value that is not an
//! object, an object carrying no `resourceType`, or one whose `id` is not a FHIR
//! logical id — is a resource with a customer error. Both are COUNTS on the
//! job's `JobProgressReport` rather than a refusal of the request: the job ran,
//! and what it found is what it reports.
//!
//! # What the job then reports
//!
//! The counts come from the run itself, and the terminal status follows them: a
//! run that imported every resource it scanned is `COMPLETED`, one that could
//! not import some of them is `COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS`, and one that imported
//! nothing — an input nothing could be read from, or an emulator retention
//! ceiling reached — is `FAILED` with the `Message` saying which. Nothing is
//! reported as imported that the data store does not hold.
