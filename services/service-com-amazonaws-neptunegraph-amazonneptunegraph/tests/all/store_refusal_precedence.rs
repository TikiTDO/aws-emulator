//! The ORDER in which a minting operation of this service decides its refusals, driven
//! over the wire (`restJson1`) through the same router the emulator serves from.
//!
//! The rule every assertion here is about: an operation that mints a record decides the
//! refusals that depend only on what the store ALREADY HOLDS — an identity already taken
//! and a store with no room left — before any precondition on the status of the record
//! it reads from, so a request that breaks both at once is answered by the store-level
//! refusal. Nothing the source record goes on to do changes either store-level fact — no
//! status it reaches makes room in a full store or frees a taken name — while the two
//! refusals ask the caller for different things, so which one is reported is part of the
//! answer and not an accident of the order the checks happen to be written in.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: every operation of this service that
//! mints a record into a bounded store and also gates on a source record's status
//! (`StartExportTask`, `StartImportTask`, `CreateGraphSnapshot`,
//! `CreatePrivateGraphEndpoint` and `RestoreGraphFromSnapshot` —
//! `smithy_query(query="digest")` lists the five), both kinds of store-level refusal (a
//! reached ceiling and a taken identity), both error classes a reached ceiling is
//! reported in (the 409 of an operation that models no quota error and the 402 of one
//! that does), and both kinds of source record (a graph, read in several statuses, and a
//! snapshot).
//!
//! Every row also asserts the CONTROL: the identical request, with the source record in
//! the identical state but room in the store (or a free identity), is refused by the
//! status gate. So each row really does break both conditions at once, and what it
//! measures is precedence rather than one refusal having swallowed the other.
//!
//! The filler records are written through the store's own writers, which is where an
//! accepted call writes them: driving any of these stores to its ceiling over the wire is
//! not possible against one graph, since each accepted call takes a resource through a
//! transient status, and every call whose ANSWER is asserted goes over the wire.
