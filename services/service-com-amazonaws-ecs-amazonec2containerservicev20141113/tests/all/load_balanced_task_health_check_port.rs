//! The HEALTH Elastic Load Balancing reports for the task of a load-balanced ECS service
//! follows whether that task's container listens on the port the target group's health check
//! connects to.
//!
//! The rule under test, over the whole class rather than one request:
//!
//! > A load balancer health-checks a registration on the target group's EFFECTIVE
//! > health-check port — `HealthCheckPort` when it names one, and the port the target
//! > receives traffic on when it names `traffic-port` or nothing — so an ECS task whose
//! > containers do not listen on that port answers no check: it is never reported `healthy`
//! > and settles on `unhealthy`, carrying one of the reason codes `TargetHealth$Reason`
//! > documents for that state and a description, while a task whose containers do listen on
//! > it converges to `healthy` with no reason code and no description. What a task listens
//! > on is what its revision declares: the `containerPort`s of its containers'
//! > `portMappings`, which for an `awsvpc` task are the ports its own interface's address is
//! > reached on.
//!
//! `TargetHealthStateEnum` names the states (`initial`, `healthy`, `unhealthy`, …) and
//! `TargetHealth$Reason` the codes each is reported with — "if the target state is `healthy`,
//! a reason code is not provided", and for `unhealthy` one of `Target.ResponseCodeMismatch`,
//! `Target.Timeout`, `Target.FailedHealthChecks`, `Elb.InternalError`
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="TargetHealth",
//! model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-elasticloadbalancingv2-elasticloadbalancing-v10/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-elasticloadbalancingv2-elasticloadbalancing-v10.json")`).
//! That a static mapping is what an `awsvpc` task's ports are is `PortMapping`'s own: "for
//! containers in a task with the `awsvpc` network mode, the `hostPortRange` is set to the same
//! value as the `containerPortRange`".
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: a health check left at the traffic
//! port, one pointed at a port the container declares no mapping for, and one pointed at a
//! SECOND port the container does declare. The configuration a recording happens to show — a
//! container port of 80 beside a health-check port of 8888 — is a single row. A second test
//! pins the bound the declared set is held to: a revision declaring more port ranges than a
//! registration carries has the first that many read, and a check against a port outside
//! them still fails.
//!
//! Nothing here reaches into a state struct: the target group, the load balancer and the
//! listener are created through the Elastic Load Balancing v2 API on the one shared engine,
//! the service through the ECS front door, and every value asserted is read back through
//! `DescribeTasks` and `DescribeTargetHealth`.
