//! Amazon ECS publishes an `ECS Task State Change` event every time a task moves.
//!
//! The RULE under test: every status a task moves into — the `lastStatus`/`desiredStatus`
//! pair it reports itself by — is published onto the account's DEFAULT EventBridge bus as
//! `source` `aws.ecs` / `detail-type` `ECS Task State Change`, whose `detail` carries the
//! task Amazon ECS holds at that instant (its `taskArn`, the `clusterArn` of the cluster it
//! runs in, its `taskDefinitionArn` and the status it moved into) and whose `resources`
//! names that task's ARN; EventBridge then routes it, so a rule whose `EventPattern`
//! matches delivers the envelope to that rule's targets and a rule that cannot match
//! receives nothing. Target-side authorization is evaluated at DELIVERY time: a queue
//! target whose own resource policy grants the EventBridge service principal
//! `sqs:SendMessage` receives the event, and one that grants nothing receives nothing while
//! `PutTargets` still succeeds. The transitions the clock owes a task are published as they
//! fall due, with no further Amazon ECS call: a client watching a task through EventBridge
//! makes none.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: WHICH door moved the task (`RunTask`,
//! `StopTask`, a service's own scheduler), the network mode and launch type it was placed
//! with — and so WHICH statuses it passes through, an `awsvpc` task starting one step
//! earlier in the lifecycle than a task that shares its host's networking — and whether the
//! target queue has granted the delivery at all.
//!
//! EventBridge and Amazon SQS are mounted BESIDE Amazon ECS on the SAME engine, so a
//! publication travels the real in-process callback, through the real bus, to a real SQS
//! target: nothing here reads the publisher's own queue.
