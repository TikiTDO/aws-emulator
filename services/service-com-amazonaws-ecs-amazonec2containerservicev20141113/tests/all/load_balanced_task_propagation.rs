//! What a TASK of a load-balanced ECS service propagates outside this service: its
//! registration as an Elastic Load Balancing v2 target while it runs, the drain that
//! registration leaves through when the task stops, and the EventBridge event every status
//! it moves into is published as.
//!
//! The rules under test, each over the whole class rather than one request:
//!
//! > A service registers each of its RUNNING tasks in every target group its
//! > `loadBalancers` entries name, addressed as that group's target type requires — for a
//! > task of an `awsvpc` revision, the private IPv4 address of the elastic network
//! > interface it was allocated, on the binding's `containerPort` — and deregisters it when
//! > the task stops, however it was stopped; a deregistered target enters `draining` and
//! > leaves the group once the group's `deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds` has passed.
//!
//! > Every `lastStatus` a task MOVES INTO is published once onto the account's default
//! > EventBridge bus as `source` `aws.ecs` / `detail-type` `ECS Task State Change`,
//! > carrying that task's own `taskArn`, `clusterArn` and `lastStatus` in the event
//! > `detail`; a rule whose `EventPattern` matches delivers it to that rule's targets, and
//! > a rule that does not match receives nothing.
//!
//! `LoadBalancer$targetGroupArn`'s own doc is the address half: "If your service's task
//! definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode, you must choose `ip` as the target type, not
//! `instance` ... because tasks that use the `awsvpc` network mode are associated with an
//! elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance"; `Attachment$details` "for
//! elastic network interfaces ... includes the network interface ID, the MAC address, the
//! subnet ID, and the private IPv4 address"; the `draining` state and the delay that ends it
//! are `TargetHealthStateEnum` and `TargetGroupAttribute$Key`'s own
//! `deregistration_delay.timeout_seconds` ("the amount of time ... to wait before changing
//! the state of a deregistering target from `draining` to `unused`"). The event envelope and
//! its `detail` are recorded behaviour.
//!
//! The tables span what each rule generalises over: how many tasks the service runs, the
//! port the binding names (the group's own, and a different one), the configured drain (none
//! and a long one), and WHICH call stops the task (`StopTask`, a scale-in through
//! `UpdateService`, and `DeleteService`) — and, for the events, the kind of task (a
//! standalone `RunTask` task and a service's).
//!
//! Nothing here reaches into a state struct: the target group, the load balancer, the rule
//! and the queue are created through their own services' APIs on the one shared engine, and
//! every value asserted is read back through `DescribeTargetHealth`, `DescribeTasks` or
//! `ReceiveMessage`.
