//! The pairing an ECS service's `loadBalancers` entry has to satisfy: the ELBv2 target
//! group it names must carry the target type the service's task-definition revision
//! registers its tasks as.
//!
//! The rule under test, over the whole class rather than one request:
//!
//! > A `loadBalancers` entry of `CreateService` or `UpdateService` names an Elastic Load
//! > Balancing v2 target group that must EXIST and whose `TargetType` must be the one the
//! > task definition's `networkMode` registers tasks as — `ip` for `awsvpc`, whose tasks
//! > each get their own elastic network interface, and `instance` for every other mode,
//! > whose tasks are reached at the container instance that runs them — and any other
//! > pairing is refused `400 InvalidParameterException` with nothing persisted.
//!
//! `LoadBalancer$targetGroupArn`'s own doc is the `awsvpc` half: "If your service's task
//! definition uses the `awsvpc` network mode, you must choose `ip` as the target type, not
//! `instance`. Do this when creating your target groups because tasks that use the
//! `awsvpc` network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon
//! EC2 instance."
//!
//! The target type is not a value the request carries: it lives in the ELBv2 service's own
//! store. So every row here creates its target group through the ELBv2 API
//! (`CreateTargetGroup` at `Version=2015-12-01`, awsQuery) on the SAME engine the ECS
//! service runs on, and the ECS call is made through the ECS front door — a cross-service
//! READ, pinned end to end rather than at the state struct.
//!
//! The `TargetType` catalog each row draws from is that service's `TargetTypeEnum`
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="TargetTypeEnum",
//! model_path="services/service-com-amazonaws-elasticloadbalancingv2-elasticloadbalancing-v10/smithy-model/com-amazonaws-elasticloadbalancingv2-elasticloadbalancing-v10.json")`:
//! `instance`, `ip`, `lambda`, `alb`), and the network modes are the ECS model's
//! `NetworkMode` enum (`bridge`, `host`, `awsvpc`, `none`).
//!
//! The pairing is decided by the REVISION's network mode alone, so it is independent of
//! how the service's tasks are PLACED: the last suite here crosses it with the placement
//! the request asks for (a `launchType`, or a `capacityProviderStrategy`), where the
//! tables above name no placement member at all.
