//! The capacity an Amazon EC2 instance LAUNCHED INTO A CLUSTER gives that cluster: the
//! registration the container agent running on the instance makes for it.
//!
//! # The rule this module implements
//!
//! "The EC2 launch type runs your tasks on Amazon EC2 instances registered to your
//! cluster", and `RegisterContainerInstance` — "this action is only used by the Amazon ECS
//! agent, and it is not intended for use outside of the agent" — is how an instance becomes
//! one of them. The agent is not a client: it runs ON the instance, reads the cluster it is
//! to join from its own configuration, and registers itself once the instance is up. The
//! cluster that configuration names is what a launch puts in the instance's USER DATA — the
//! agent's `ECS_CLUSTER` variable, which the documented way of joining a cluster writes into
//! the agent's configuration file.
//!
//! So: a RUNNING instance of the account whose user data configures the agent with a cluster
//! of the account is a registered container instance of that cluster, from one
//! [`AGENT_REGISTRATION_SPAN`] after its launch — and it stops being capacity when the
//! instance is no longer there to run anything: a stopped instance runs no agent (so its
//! registration reports no connected agent, and nothing is placed on it), and a terminated
//! instance's registration is deregistered, which is the `INACTIVE` status a deregistration
//! leaves ("the instance then transitions to an `INACTIVE` status").
//!
//! The registration is owed by the CLOCK and not by any call: the agent registers on its
//! own, with no client request between the launch and the cluster reporting the capacity, so
//! the pass that materialises it ([`settle_ec2_capacity`]) is run by the operations that
//! REPORT or USE that capacity and by the clock pump — each of them materialising only what
//! was already due at the instant it looks, so two reads at one instant answer identically.
//!
//! What is NOT read here is the image the instance boots: the agent ships in the
//! ECS-optimized AMI, but which AMI id that is per Region is not a fact this emulator
//! publishes, whereas the cluster in an instance's user data is a fact the launch itself
//! carried. An instance configured for a cluster the account does not hold registers
//! nowhere, exactly as its agent would be refused.
//!
//! LOCK ORDER: the Amazon EC2 store's lock is taken first and RELEASED before this service's
//! is taken, so no two store locks are ever held at once — the same contract
//! [`super::evaluate_image_pulls`] has, which is what keeps a lock cycle between the stores
//! unreachable.
