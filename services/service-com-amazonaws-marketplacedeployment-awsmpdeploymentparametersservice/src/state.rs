//! Engine state for the com-amazonaws-marketplacedeployment-awsmpdeploymentparametersservice service.
//!
//! The deployment-parameter lifecycle is backed here: every value
//! `PutDeploymentParameter`, `TagResource`, `UntagResource` and
//! `ListTagsForResource` report is read out of one of these records, never built
//! from the request that asked for it.
//!
//! A record also carries the EXPIRY the last write named
//! (`expirationDate`), and that date is enforced here: every operation that
//! resolves a deployment parameter first materialises the deletion the clock has
//! made due ([`ComAmazonawsMarketplacedeploymentAwsmpdeploymentparametersserviceState::purge_expired`]),
//! so no caller ever sees a parameter past its expiration date. For the
//! operations that resolve a parameter by the `resourceArn` the CALLER supplied,
//! that whole sequence — judge the ARN as an input, take the store, materialise
//! the due expiry, then resolve the record or answer the service's not-found
//! failure — is this module's [`with_tagged_parameter`], so the rule is stated
//! and applied in one place rather than re-derived per handler; the operations
//! whose success WRITES the record it resolves take [`write_tagged_parameter`],
//! which is that same sequence plus the one thing a write owes the record it
//! changed: the instant it was written
//! ([`DeploymentParameterRecord::mark_written`]).
//!
//! The AGREEMENTS a deployment parameter is written against are held here too
//! ([`ProvisionedAgreement`]). This API models no operation that creates a
//! product or an agreement — in AWS an agreement appears when a buyer accepts a
//! seller's offer, entirely out of band of this service — so an agreement is a
//! PRECONDITION of a deployment-parameter write and never something the write
//! establishes: `PutDeploymentParameter` RESOLVES its target against this store
//! ([`ComAmazonawsMarketplacedeploymentAwsmpdeploymentparametersserviceState::holds_target`])
//! and a target the store does not hold is the modelled
//! `ResourceNotFoundException` ([`target_not_found`]).
//!
//! Because the out-of-band creation has to come from somewhere, a fresh store is
//! already holding the fixture targets [`DEFAULT_AGREEMENTS`] names, in every
//! catalog this service serves — so the operation's documented create path is
//! reachable by an ordinary signed request with no in-process help — and
//! [`seed_agreements`] records further targets for a fixture that wants its own.
