//! End-to-end HTTP tests for the Lex Models V2 bot lifecycle slice: `CreateBot`,
//! `DescribeBot`, `ListBots`, `UpdateBot`, `DeleteBot`.
//!
//! Every request goes through the same `MultiServiceRouter::dispatch` the emulator
//! serves on its socket, so the restJson1 routing, the modelled constraints and the
//! error envelopes are exercised exactly as a client sees them.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a TABLE of inputs rather than one case:
//!
//! * a create mints an id matching the modelled `Id` shape and stores the record, so a
//!   read of that id reports back what was stored;
//! * an update replaces the stored definition and a later read reports the new values;
//! * a delete removes the record, so a later read cannot find it;
//! * a listing is built from the stored records, filtered, ordered and paged;
//! * an id no record carries is refused with the error each operation's model declares.
