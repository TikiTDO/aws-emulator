//! The Iceberg REST catalog this service serves beside its control plane.
//!
//! # Not a modelled operation
//!
//! S3 Tables serves an Apache Iceberg REST catalog at `/iceberg/v1` alongside
//! the control plane, and that catalog is how every data-plane consumer of a
//! table (Spark, Trino, PyIceberg, Athena) reads the table: it loads the table's
//! metadata document to learn the table's columns and their field ids, where the
//! table's files live and which UUID identifies it, and it commits a change to
//! the table's metadata back through the same route. None of it is in this
//! service's Smithy model — no modelled operation binds `/iceberg/v1/*` — so
//! nothing in the generated routing table can name these requests, and they are
//! reached through the seam an emulated data plane uses:
//!
//! * [`crate::service::EmulatedService::override_operation`] resolves a request
//!   addressed beneath the catalog's path space to [`IcebergCatalog`], which is
//!   an author-written operation rather than a modelled one;
//! * that operation declares SigV4 ([`ErasedOperation::auth_schemes`]), so the
//!   router verifies the request's signature before it runs — the catalog is
//!   signed traffic, exactly as the control plane is.
//!
//! # What is served
//!
//! The table endpoint of the catalog,
//! `/iceberg/v1/{prefix}/namespaces/{namespace}/tables/{table}`, where `prefix`
//! is the table bucket's ARN (the warehouse the catalog is addressed for):
//!
//! * `GET` loads the table: the table's stored metadata document and the
//!   location of the metadata file it is written to;
//! * `HEAD` answers whether the table exists;
//! * `POST` commits updates to the table's metadata, under the requirements the
//!   commit states, and answers with the committed document.
//!
//! Every answer is projected from the SAME records the control-plane handlers
//! read and write ([`crate::state::Table`] and its
//! [`crate::state::IcebergTableMetadata`]), so the catalog and the control plane
//! cannot disagree about a table: a schema a `CreateTable` declared is the
//! schema a load reports, and a sort order a commit adds is the sort order
//! `PutTableMaintenanceConfiguration` judges a compaction strategy against.
//!
//! # The envelope
//!
//! A refusal is answered in the envelope of the API the request addressed — the
//! Iceberg REST catalog's own error document (`error.message`, `error.type`,
//! `error.code`) — never in this service's restJson1 error shapes, which belong
//! to the modelled operations.
