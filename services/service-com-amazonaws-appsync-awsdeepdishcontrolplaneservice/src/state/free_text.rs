//! The members of this service whose modelled `@pattern` admits any text at all, and
//! the one bound that is left on them: their `@length`.
//!
//! A member whose pattern is `^.*$` is satisfied by every value it can hold. `.` stands
//! for any character, `^` and `$` are evaluated per LINE, and the expression is matched
//! as a search over the value, so a value carrying newlines satisfies it exactly as a
//! single-line one does — the pattern states no restriction to enforce. Such a member's
//! CONTENT is therefore never refusable, and the only thing a request can get wrong
//! about it is its SIZE.
//!
//! This service has two such shapes
//! (`smithy_query(query="shape", shape="MappingTemplate,Description")`):
//!
//! * `MappingTemplate`, `@length` 1..65536 — the request and response mapping templates
//!   of `CreateResolver`/`UpdateResolver`/`CreateFunction`/`UpdateFunction`, written in
//!   Apache Velocity (VTL), whose `#if`/`#foreach`/`#end` directives and pretty-printed
//!   JSON are line-oriented, so a real template spans several lines;
//! * `Description`, `@length` 0..255 — the description of
//!   `CreateDomainName`/`UpdateDomainName`.
//!
//! Those members are off the request boundary (`skip_validation` in `src/ops/types/`),
//! because the boundary matches a `@pattern` as a whole-string anchored match with `.`
//! stopping at a line terminator and would refuse every multi-line value; the checks
//! here take over the bound the boundary stopped reading, so a value too long (or, for a
//! template, empty) is still refused — as the service's own `BadRequestException`, the
//! only client error these operations model.
