//! The Event API's DATA plane: what ANSWERS at the two endpoints `CreateApi` publishes in
//! `Api$dns`.
//!
//! An Event API "provides real-time message publishing and message subscriptions over
//! WebSockets" (`Api`), and `Api$dns` "will include an HTTP and a real-time endpoint". Those
//! two values are not labels: a publisher POSTs an event document to the HTTP one and a
//! subscriber completes an RFC 6455 opening handshake against the real-time one and then
//! exchanges frames over it. So each is a SOCKET this emulator answers on:
//!
//! * [`publish`] — the HTTP endpoint, which serves `POST /event`: it resolves the channel's
//!   channel namespace, runs that namespace's `onPublish` handler over the events the
//!   request carried ([`handlers`]), delivers what the handler returned to every matching
//!   subscription, and answers which events it accepted;
//! * [`realtime`] — the real-time endpoint, which serves the WebSocket at
//!   `/event/realtime`: `connection_init`/`connection_ack`, `subscribe`/`unsubscribe`, the
//!   `publish` a client makes over its own socket, and the `data` frames an event is
//!   delivered to a subscriber as.
//!
//! Both are opened when the API is created ([`open_for_api`], called by `CreateApi`) and
//! closed when it is deleted, and every answer either gives is computed from this service's
//! own records — the API, its authorization configuration, its API keys, its channel
//! namespaces and their handler code — read under the one shared store lock
//! ([`crate::state::event_data_plane`]).
//!
//! # Why the plane is a socket of its own, and what it is announced as
//!
//! An Event API cannot be served through the emulator's front door: that door serves ONE
//! buffered request per call, and the seams a service is given (`Service::can_handle`,
//! `Service::override_operation`, `Service::override_routing_error`) take an
//! already-buffered request and return a buffered response, so nothing there can switch a
//! connection to another protocol and carry frames over it. What a WebSocket endpoint needs
//! is a socket, which is what the core lends a service for a resource with a native
//! protocol: `engine.listeners().tcp_plaintext(handler)` binds it on the operator-chosen
//! interface (loopback by default), assigns the port, caps the connections and severs them
//! when the handle is dropped, and hands this module each accepted connection's byte
//! stream.
//!
//! Each socket is handed over PLAINTEXT and the first byte says what the client opened
//! with ([`negotiated`]): a TLS record is handed to the core's own TLS server
//! ([`::emulator_server::TlsUpgrader`]) and everything after it is read decrypted, while an
//! HTTP method is read as it stands. So ONE announced address serves both the `https://`
//! and `wss://` a client of AWS dials and the `http://`/`ws://` a client that does not
//! verify a self-signed certificate dials, and this service never touches a key or a
//! certificate.
//!
//! The addresses the two sockets land on are what the API publishes as its `dns` records
//! ([`crate::state::event_api_dns`]), because the whole purpose of those values is that a
//! client dials them and no client on this machine resolves an AWS hostname.
