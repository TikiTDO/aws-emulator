//! The schema of a GraphQL API, end to end over HTTP: `StartSchemaCreation`, the
//! `GetSchemaCreationStatus` that reports how it went, and the types the created schema
//! leaves the API holding.
//!
//! The rules asserted here are stated over CLASSES of input rather than over the one
//! request that exposed the defect:
//!
//! 1. creating a schema is ASYNCHRONOUS: the call schedules the creation and answers
//!    the non-terminal `PROCESSING` state, which the clock then carries to `SUCCESS`
//!    with no further call, and the document's own types are what the API holds
//!    afterwards — each addressable by the name its definition declares, carrying that
//!    definition's description, the kind its keyword declares and an ARN named under the
//!    API's own path. Asserted over a table of documents spanning every kind of type
//!    GraphQL's SDL grammar declares, a document that also carries definitions which
//!    declare no type (a `schema` definition, a directive definition) and one that
//!    EXTENDS a type it declares;
//! 2. a document that defines no type system the API can hold settles to `FAILED`,
//!    carrying the reason as the status detail and leaving the API without types — over
//!    a table spanning a document GraphQL cannot parse, one that declares no type, one
//!    that declares a name twice, one that extends a type it does not declare, one that
//!    references a type nothing defines, and a payload that is not text at all;
//! 3. a schema document is the WHOLE type system: the types a creation installs replace
//!    the ones the API held, so a type the new document does not declare is gone,
//!    whether an earlier document or a `CreateType` put it there;
//! 4. while the creation the clock owes is in progress, a second creation and a
//!    `CreateType` are both refused 409 `ConcurrentModificationException`, and the
//!    creation those refusals left alone still comes due;
//! 5. an API no creation has ever run for is in `NOT_APPLICABLE`, an `apiId` that cannot
//!    name an API is a 400 `BadRequestException` and one that names no API this account
//!    holds a 404 `NotFoundException` — for the creating call and the reporting one
//!    alike.
//!
//! The harness (`router`, `call`, `create_api`) is the one the association suites
//! already carry, so every assertion goes through the router the production emulator
//! mounts: routing, restJson1 (de)serialization, the handlers and the shared engine
//! together.
