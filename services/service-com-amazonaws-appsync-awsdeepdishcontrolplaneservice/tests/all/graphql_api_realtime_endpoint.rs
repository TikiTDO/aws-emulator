//! A GraphQL API's REAL-TIME endpoint, driven over a real socket: the address the API
//! publishes for it, the opening handshake it completes, the conversation it carries and
//! the `AWS/AppSync` connect series it publishes.
//!
//! The rule these cases assert, one level above the recorded case (one API created with
//! `API_KEY`, a subscription-bearing schema, and a client dialling `uris.REALTIME`):
//!
//! > A GraphQL API publishes, as its `REALTIME` endpoint, the address of the socket that
//! > endpoint is SERVED on — `dns.REALTIME` the `host:port` and `uris.REALTIME` the
//! > `wss://` URL over it — so a client that dials what the API published reaches this
//! > emulator. There it completes an RFC 6455 opening handshake on `/graphql` offering the
//! > `graphql-ws` subprotocol, and one addressed to anything else is refused. Over the
//! > established socket `connection_init` is answered `connection_ack` when the material
//! > the connection carries authorizes a connection to the API and `connection_error`
//! > otherwise — which ends the connection — a `start` on a subscription field of the
//! > API's own schema `start_ack`, and the `stop` that ends one `complete`. Each connect is
//! > reported in CloudWatch's `AWS/AppSync` namespace under `[GraphQLAPIId]`:
//! > `ConnectSuccess` for one this endpoint established, `ConnectClientError` for one it
//! > refused.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: the material a handshake presents (a live
//! key, none, an unknown key, a key of another API), what it addresses (the endpoint's path
//! and another, its subprotocol and none), where a browser made it from, and what a `start`
//! names (a declared subscription field, an undeclared one, no document, no id, an id
//! already in use).
