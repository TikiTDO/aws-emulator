//! How AWS Backup REFUSES — and does not refuse — a call about a backup plan or
//! one of its resource selections, driven as real HTTP through the router.
//!
//! The rules under test, each asserted over a table whose rows differ along what
//! the rule generalises over rather than on one recorded request:
//!
//! * a plan body is stored only when every rule's `ScheduleExpression` is an
//!   expression jobs can be initiated from; one that is not is refused with the
//!   per-rule validation envelope — the class's `Code`, the reason whole in
//!   `Context`, and that reason after the envelope's fixed prefix in `Message` —
//!   by every operation that stores a plan body, and nothing is stored;
//! * a backup selection is stored only for an `IamRoleArn` that names a role
//!   this account's IAM shows AWS Backup can assume;
//! * the two halves of the (`BackupPlanId`, `SelectionId`) pair are refused
//!   APART: a plan id the account holds no plan under is the parameter-value
//!   class with the asking call's own token, a selection id the plan does not
//!   hold is the absent selection with its own;
//! * a selection delete is idempotent once the plan is resolved: a selection id
//!   the plan does not hold answers the same empty success as the first delete;
//! * a listing of the selections of a plan that holds none reports an EMPTY
//!   list, not a refusal;
//! * a plan delete that finds no plan to read the latest version of names the
//!   plan it could not read, by the ARN built from the request's own region and
//!   the id it carried;
//! * a plan READ that cannot resolve the version it asks for — the one it named
//!   or the plan's latest — carries the unreadable-version token and sentence.
//!
//! The request harness (`call_reported`, `router`, `ACCOUNT`, `REGION`) is the
//! one `vault_and_backup_job.rs` exposes to this test binary, so there is ONE
//! wire path for the service's suites; the region-varying sender below is this
//! suite's own, since no other suite signs for a second region. The IAM-mounted
//! router and the `CreateRole` sender beside it are `pub(crate)`, because every
//! suite whose rule turns on what IAM holds for a role needs exactly that one
//! emulator and that one way of creating the role it names.
