//! The EventBridge events this service publishes as a JOB moves: one event per state
//! change of a backup job, one per state change of a copy job and one per state change of
//! a restore job.
//!
//! # The rule this module implements
//!
//! AWS Backup does not only record a job's progress for a reader to poll: every state a
//! job MOVES INTO after the call that started it is PUBLISHED onto the account's default
//! EventBridge bus, under the `source` this service owns ([`EVENT_SOURCE`]) and the
//! `detail-type` of the KIND of job that moved ([`BACKUP_JOB_STATE_CHANGE`],
//! [`COPY_JOB_STATE_CHANGE`], [`RESTORE_JOB_STATE_CHANGE`]), carrying that job's own stored
//! members — the state it moved
//! into among them — as the event's `detail` and the recovery point the job is about in
//! `resources`. A rule on that bus whose `EventPattern` matches then delivers the envelope
//! unchanged to every one of that rule's targets, so a client that reacts to a backup, a
//! copy or a restore through EventBridge observes the job without calling AWS Backup again
//! — and ONE rule whose pattern lists several detail-types receives every kind of envelope
//! it names.
//!
//! The state a START call stored is not a move: it is what that call's own response
//! reports, so the snapshot is seeded with it and the events published are the transitions
//! that follow it (the settle to `COMPLETED` the clock owes, and any later one).
//!
//! # How a change becomes an event
//!
//! Nothing here decides WHEN anything moves: the stored job and the clock do
//! ([`super::ComAmazonawsBackupCryocontrollerusermanagerState::settle_job`],
//! [`super::ComAmazonawsBackupCryocontrollerusermanagerState::settle_copy_job`],
//! [`super::ComAmazonawsBackupCryocontrollerusermanagerState::settle_restore_job`]), and a
//! state they write is the fact an event reports. So this module is a DIFF rather than a
//! second state machine:
//! [`super::ComAmazonawsBackupCryocontrollerusermanagerState::record_job_state_changes`]
//! compares every stored job against the state last published for it ([`JobEventLog`],
//! held in the store beside the jobs) and queues one change per state that differs —
//! whichever call materialised it, and without any transition site having to remember to
//! announce itself.
//!
//! A queued change is published by [`publish_job_state_changes`], which runs with NO lock
//! held: EventBridge is reached the way every emulated service reaches another, through the
//! framework's in-process callback and the tree's one client for that hop
//! ([`::service_common::eventbridge_client`]), so this crate names no other service's crate
//! and the publication opens no socket off this process. Each change is published in the
//! Region its own JOB belongs to, read off that job's stored vault ARN, so which call or
//! clock tick drains the queue decides nothing about where an event arrives. Publication is
//! best effort — an emulator with no EventBridge mounted has nowhere to publish — so a
//! failure is logged and the operation's own result stands.
//!
//! The queue is BOUNDED ([`MAX_PENDING_EVENTS`], oldest dropped first) because every
//! transition appends to it, one drain publishes at most [`MAX_PUBLISHED_PER_DRAIN`]
//! changes, and the snapshot is pruned to the jobs the store still holds, so none of the
//! three grows with the number of calls served.
