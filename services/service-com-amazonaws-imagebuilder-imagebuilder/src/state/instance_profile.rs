//! Whether the instance profile a configuration names is one this account holds.
//!
//! `CreateInfrastructureConfiguration`'s `instanceProfileName` is "the instance profile to
//! associate with the instance used to customize your Amazon EC2 AMI" — an IAM resource of
//! the caller's own account. Its model says only what such a NAME looks like (required,
//! `@length(1..256)`, `@pattern ^[\w+=,.@-]+$`), so a well-formed name that no profile
//! exists under satisfies the model and whether it resolves is a question for IAM: Image
//! Builder resolves it when the configuration is created, and refuses the create — writing
//! nothing — when this account holds no such profile.
//!
//! IAM is reached the way any emulated service reaches another: the ONE in-process IAM
//! client this tree builds that hop with ([`service_common::iam_client::iam_client`]), over
//! the operation callback, so this crate names no other service crate and no request leaves
//! the process.
//!
//! ## What grounds a refusal
//!
//! The two ways the lookup fails to find a profile are different claims, and only one of
//! them is about the value the request carried:
//!
//! * IAM ANSWERED that this account holds no profile of that name (`NoSuchEntity`) — a fact
//!   about `instanceProfileName`, so the create is refused as that parameter's value;
//! * nothing answered the lookup at all — this emulator was assembled with no IAM to ask —
//!   so nothing about the profile is established and the create proceeds rather than
//!   refusing a value no answer placed.
