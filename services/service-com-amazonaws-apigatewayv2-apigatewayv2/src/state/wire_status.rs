//! The HTTP status a mutating operation of this service ANSWERS, where that is not the
//! status the model's `@http` trait declares for it.
//!
//! A `@http code` is the status an operation is modelled to answer, and for most of this
//! service it is the status API Gateway really answers. For a handful of writes it is not:
//! the service answers a status of its own, and a client or waiter that asserts what the
//! service sends sees the model's code as an unexpected one. The status on the wire is the
//! requirement, so those operations answer it, and each constant below says which
//! operations it governs and what it means to a caller.
//!
//! It is a per-operation fact, not a property of the HTTP method or of the kind of write:
//! `UpdateApiMapping`, `UpdateStage`, `UpdateIntegration` and the other patches whose
//! answer agrees with their `@http code` keep it, and every operation not named below is
//! left answering the status its own `@http code` declares.
//!
//! Each `impl Operation` names the constant that governs it in its `SUCCESS_STATUS`, so the
//! statuses that differ from the model are stated once, here, rather than as a bare number
//! in each handler.

/// `201 Created`, the status a PATCH that rewrites an api or one of its children is
