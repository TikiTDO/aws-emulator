//! End-to-end HTTP tests for the ADDRESS a product REST endpoint page publishes for the

//! `displayContent.endpoint` named a host nothing here serves):
//!
//! > An address this service publishes for a consumer to DIAL is the address this emulator
//! > itself serves that resource at, chosen by the endpoint the writing request reached: a

//! > stage its `RestEndpointIdentifier` names ("The URL to invoke your REST API",
//! > `EndpointDisplayContentResponse$Endpoint`), so every operation that reports the page
//! > publishes that one address and a request to it reaches the stage's integration.
//!
//! The rows span what the rule generalises over: the endpoint the writing request was
//! addressed at (a loopback literal with a port, a loopback NAME on another port, and one of
//! AWS's own service hosts), each signed for a different Region, with a different stage name
//! and a different documented method and path. Each row is driven through every operation
//! that reports a page (`CreateProductRestEndpointPage`, `GetProductRestEndpointPage`,
//! `UpdateProductRestEndpointPage`), and the published address is then DIALED: the page
//! endpoint is only a fix if the stage answers on it.
//!
//! The REST API, its `MOCK` integration and its stage are created through the service that
//! OWNS them (`apigateway:CreateRestApi`, `apigateway:PutMethod`,
//! `apigateway:PutIntegration`, `apigateway:CreateDeployment`), mounted beside this one on
//! the same shared engine exactly as the router mounts them, so the address asserted here is
//! served by the owner of REST APIs and not by anything this suite set up itself.
//!
//! An endpoint the request OVERRODE is the caller's own value and is reported as given: that
//! is the last row of the update table.
