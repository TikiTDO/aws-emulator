//! The security groups a load balancer CARRIES, driven with both services on one engine.
//!
//! One rule is under test: a load balancer of a family whose load balancers are always
//! governed by a security group carries one from the moment it exists, so a create that
//! names no `SecurityGroups` is placed in the DEFAULT security group of the VPC its
//! subnets are in — the group EC2 created with that VPC — while a create that names groups
//! carries exactly those, and a family that may carry none carries none.
//!
//! Which group is a VPC's default one is EC2's to say, so every row here runs against VPCs
//! created through EC2 itself and compares what `DescribeLoadBalancers` reports against
//! what EC2 answers for `group-name=default` in that VPC. That is why this suite lives
//! here rather than in the ELBv2 crate: with no EC2 to ask, nothing is known about the
//! VPC's groups and none is attached.
//!
//! Assembling the whole router costs stack (see `boot_serve.rs`), so it is built — and the
//! requests driven — on a sized thread. The request plumbing is
//! `elbv2_network_resolution.rs`'s, reused rather than written twice.
