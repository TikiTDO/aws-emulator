//! An ECS service's task is reported HEALTHY by Elastic Load Balancing only while the
//! container behind it listens on the port the target group's health check connects to.
//!
//! RULE: a load balancer health-checks a registration on the target group's effective
//! health-check port — `HealthCheckPort` when it names one, and the port the target receives
//! traffic on when it names `traffic-port` or nothing — so a target whose workload does not
//! listen on that port answers no check: it is never reported `healthy` and settles on
//! `unhealthy` with the reason its check failed for and a description, while a target whose
//! workload does listen on it converges to `healthy` with no reason code. What a task
//! listens on is what its revision declares: the `containerPort`s of its containers'
//! `portMappings`, which for an `awsvpc` task are the very ports its own interface's address
//! is reached on.
//!
//! Two crates have to agree for that to hold, which is why this suite lives here: ECS
//! declares the ports of the task it registers, and Elastic Load Balancing v2 checks the
//! registration against the group's health-check port — over the account's EC2 records, which
//! hold the network the task's interface is placed in. Everything is driven through the real
//! operations on one engine, so what is asserted is what ECS persisted and what ELBv2 reports
//! for it.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: a health check left at the traffic
//! port, one pointed at a port the container does not listen on, and one pointed at a second
//! port the container DOES listen on. The configuration a recording happens to show — a
//! container port of 80 beside a health-check port of 8888 — is a single row.
