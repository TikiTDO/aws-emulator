//! An ECS service's task is reported HEALTHY by Elastic Load Balancing only while the
//! security groups the placement gave it admit the load balancer's health check.
//!
//! RULE: a health check is a connection the load balancer opens to the target on the target
//! group's effective health-check port, so it only arrives if an INBOUND rule of a security
//! group governing that target names both that port and that load balancer as a source — "a
//! security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that
//! it is associated with" (Amazon VPC User Guide, "Security groups"). A target whose groups
//! carry no such rule answers no check: it is never reported `healthy` and settles on
//! `unhealthy` with the reason its check failed for and a description. A target whose groups
//! do carry one converges to `healthy` with no reason code, and a target whose groups the
//! account holds nothing for is failed on nothing: no rule was read either way.
//!
//! Three crates have to agree for that to hold, which is why this suite lives here: ECS
//! declares the security groups of the task it registers
//! (`AwsVpcConfiguration$securityGroups`), EC2 owns those groups and their rules, and Elastic
//! Load Balancing v2 reads the rules against the load balancer performing the check.
//! Everything is driven through the real operations on one engine, so what is asserted is
//! what each service persisted.
//!
//! The rows differ along what the rule generalises over: the kind of source a rule names (the
//! load balancer's own group, an address range covering it, the whole address family, another
//! group), whether the rule's port range covers the checked port, the protocol it names, a
//! group with no inbound rule at all, and a group the account does not hold. The recorded
//! configuration — a task group that admits the checked port from somewhere other than the
//! load balancer — is a single row.
